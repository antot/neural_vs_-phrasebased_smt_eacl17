<seg id="1">The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is "no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and several weapons would only escalate the violence and suffering of millions of people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ban said Wednesday at a news conference that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation intractable."</seg>
<seg id="6">Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 figures in the polls showing that Donald Trump has a real chance</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop."</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have called him a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Others waiting for the implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But regardless of how some republicans are trying to tear down on Donald Trump in the top of the polls, did not (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a double-digit percentage and some are starting to wonder seriously what does this mean for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still premature.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advancement it was Herman Cain's place in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="10">And why would fight hard in the general elections are legion.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups such as the Super CAP of Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and begin to support it with money.</seg>
<seg id="12">Next we present a few figures in recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something fleeting:</seg>
<seg id="13">The figures indicating support Trump returned to 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even before Donald Trump to announce his candidacy, in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40%.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52%.</seg>
<seg id="17">Currently, six out of 10 republicans have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in 10 say they have a negative view.</seg>
<seg id="19">These figures remain.</seg>
<seg id="20">A poll last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60% of the region's Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, 67% of republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump would win the race for the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm that Trump (43% say they would be "thrilled" with 40% who say the same thing about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The closest in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, with only 21%.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush is the favorite to win the race for the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans do not believe Trump's temperament is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for the insults and his bombast, 52% of Republican voters nationally believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC News / Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="30">Regasim same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44% believe that it does not have the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When you take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is genuine.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to a poll conducted last week by CNN / ORC, the question of who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="35">The situation has changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would be bet on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: In the past, the GOP voters have not read very well the future.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 republicans have elected Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, these figures show that the most plausible GOP voters believe Trump's campaign.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans or repliat toward another candidate. Trump still tops the all.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some say that the split is likely to help Trump's victory, while supporting against Trump will share in more than a dozen candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">Trump is at a distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio's 14 points, 15 points from Walker, on 19 points of Jeb Bush and, finally, at 33 points apiece from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is almost on par with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beat?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation one to one.</seg>
<seg id="46">Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have been decided.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll released Tuesday by CBS / NYT shows that more than half of voters who support the Trump says it does not change their voting option.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen in this and no one can say that they will never change.</seg>
<seg id="49">46% say the loophole leaves open the possibility to change the option.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the most important opponent of Trump's is currently neurochirurgul Ben Carson, but is twice as likely voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 republicans say I agree with Trump in the immigration issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">When Donald Trump calling Mexican immigrants "rapists" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the central issue in the campaign for 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that Trump's bombast would lead to a split between senior hispanici voters and the Republican Party and will harm the rebranding efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC / Post, six out of 10 say the republicans agree with Trump in the immigration issue.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, as will remain and Doland Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the authorities reach new culmi.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status of outsideri.</seg>
<seg id="58">According to the poll conducted Monday by ABC / Post, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people are also angry with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in congress, 54% saying he is "frustrated" and 21% "nervous at culme."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn is making debut at the Prime Minister's questions</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn at PMQs debut was the long-awaited</seg>
<seg id="3">The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make their debut later in Prime Minister's questions, faced for the first time with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions about who has the right shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be looked at closely by the media and Labour MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The weekly aparitiilor, he called for "less theatrical and more facts."</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that he can give up a few deployments and succumb to his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Confrontation will be the first test of Mr Corbyn MP in the leading position, coming after he called a "shadow cabinet" and after the speech he delivered Tuesday at the TUC annual congress.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent on rostirea national anthem during a service held Tuesday with the anniversary of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers and made headlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said he "respectfully silent" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of the shadow cabinet of Mr Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the Two's Newsnight by the BBC that he had recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Around a dozen shadow cabinet ministers have refused to be part of the leadership team of Mr Corbyn, arguing with the differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says political differences are "total" in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr Corbyn on his position on the European Union and limit benefits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will eliminate the whole idea of limiting.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labor and Pension, said the party is "very clear" in the sole opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" of the 26,000 pounds mounted on pounds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, when he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="17">Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to ask God Cameron and received more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Islington North MP said PMQs implies a level of confrontation is too high and that it will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take place at PMQs when he can't attend - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also expressed the idea that will allow others to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the Chamber of Deputies Speaker, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wants to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed in his approach.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way in which he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among fellow lawmakers, although critics say it has become a caricature, and that requires a deep reform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticized for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was the victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more praise and criticism, Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo often called the Special "KS," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous derapajul Kyrgios had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a qualification game crancen played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the seat of the referee had to intervene twice to split the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him down on Kyrgios, and I should have put it down on pustiul."</seg>
<seg id="6">Although it was last seen making a rocket dust after he had crampe muscular diseases and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Adolescentul is currently in Glasgow, where he struggles with Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing that I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a bit at odds," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The truth is that ruptured a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in the US, but it is not the first player to break a rocket in frustration with himself and Thanasi know him well enough to know that he would not be proud of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">But to be serious, has permeated extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so forth, and I think it deserves a lot of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Has a great team, has a great family together and I think he was treated unfairly.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a very mature young man of 19 years, is working hard and has been integrated into the team, has not had any conflict with the other players, is highly respected, trains hard, is in excellent form, it is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also defended the decision to not take into account the important station Kyrgios for the match, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but claimed the player's return from long-term Canberra team.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Firstly, we want the team to focus entirely on the station and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick moved very quickly, as people have said such as Federer and Murray, he is maturing under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserve to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him to understand the consequences of his facts and I think it needs a time that is not in the spotlight in order to be able to reflect, good thing both for the team and for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national polls</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a double-digit advantage in the race for the Democratic candidacy nationally, but Senatorul Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democrat voters (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up 17%).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, it is supported by 15% of Democrat voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">At least five months before the primary election, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">The poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="9">Support among men has shrunk considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democrat voters under the age of 50 years has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton is still in the lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton is in front of Sanders, with a double-digit percentage, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage by 5 points in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the Democrat voters nationwide say they would support a Clinton enthusiastically if it had chosen to run on behalf of the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and the other 15% would support it only because it is the party.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters to be enthusiastic about its choice is high.</seg>
<seg id="17">Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 per cent of Democrat voters say they would support it enthusiastically on Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first was Donald Trump (35%) is lower.</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are being asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the answer is that it has the proper experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time for a woman to be president (13%) and that is the best candidate for the job (10%).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters also mentions her association with Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">It also notes the agreement on these issues and eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="22">Given that the vice president takes into account a possible presidential bid, 57% of Democrat voters would like to see him in the race - although a third I think I should not run.</seg>
<seg id="23">Question on the second option for the party's representative, Democrat voters call it a majority on Biden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to run in the race for the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders's rise, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if it is running.</seg>
<seg id="26">55% of Democrat voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78% as they were last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is in distant second place but the percentage that is most eligible grew.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democrat voters prefer the problems instead of eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Just like last month, no Democrat candidate or possible candidate is not considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democrat candidates or possible candidates are faring well in terms of a few key features to their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">The majority of voters view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trust and with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden is seen the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">30% of Democrat voters do not believe that H. Clinton is trustworthy and integrate, twice more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democrat voters generally also believes that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology as well.</seg>
<seg id="35">On all these issues, about a quarter of Democrat voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, the majority of Democrats are satisfied with their explanation on the subject and say that it has not affected the overall opinion of the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is not the case among the American public.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was divided on this issue in March, shortly after the issue has come to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say the controversy over email has not affected the overall opinion about Clinton, while 36% say they have changed their mind in a negative way.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Democrat voters see Clinton as trustworthy and integrate, this continues to raise questions among voters overall: Only 32% see it as reliable and integrate, with 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of voters do not believe integrate and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55% of voters nationally do not consider Trump upstanding and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, both Clinton and Trump have the ups for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Among the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush ranks first in terms of integrity.</seg>
<seg id="47">The number of those who consider upstanding Sanders is higher than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters Democrat mayors is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is what will happen when the Fed will raise interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Interest rates will rise and the Bull market (rising market) will stand, the bond value will increase and the economy will go into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">What we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.</seg>
<seg id="5">In economics, history offers few clues on time.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the first interest rate would rise, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the response to the economy and the financial assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, the US central bank officials have grown so strong that investors should not focus on when starting to raise interest rates but the trajectory over time for normalisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Indeed, there are many variables at play.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, in the end, the market players may find that the whole flap over interest rate rise was exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first interest rate increase by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the" era of cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that seem to fear anyone.</seg>
<seg id="13">But you can't say that there will be no effect.</seg>
<seg id="14">Still present how could react to some sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">Given the situation with which the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate rise may volatiliza things for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, at the time, the impact is not so dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It seems that there is a trend that the return of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first rise, which reflects the can again defazajul in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - about 14 percent - heading for interest rate rises, quite invariabila from 250 days after (up an average of 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron's chief strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on action tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rising interest rates and the benefits are starting to decline.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recession is a fact of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to this.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current situation, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">More specifically, the gross domestic product will be closer to its historic low point for a Fed interest rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since the 1950s, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though in the second quarter of 2015 value was 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter rose only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rising interest rates in an economy so fragile could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," said Deutsche.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market players have prepared all year for a decision from the Fed, all eyes were on to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, conducted after 1950, all of the interest rate hike cycles so far have been in a super cycle of increasing profit, GDP dwarfing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the contrary, it was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and he has reached 74 months and continues.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact is more quickly in the case of bonds than stocks when the Fed policy changes.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits of changing direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of rising interest rates, bond profitability declines immediately, "said Deutsche.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab strategy I believe that these rate increases will determine near profitability between short-term bonds and long-term ones, aplatizand curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">The bonds with high profitability is faring better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," said in an analysis of Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the expectations of Fed policy.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and lower inflation estimates, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policies," wrote Jones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the cost curve is more right, spreads the average rate of interest credit has expanded and increased volatility - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Broadly, companies operating in the US will benefit from the rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">The multinationals with large debts will suffer because the dollar will lead to higher prices for their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the subsequent three months after an initial interest rate of growth," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheets have outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with large receipts from capital and stocks with low volatility have also outperformed similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">The debt will become an important issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a large percentage of debt flotanta have the most to lose, says Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Those savings could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classics FM, says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the broadcaster for "prosteste"</seg>
<seg id="3">He says it is increasingly similar to trade opponent</seg>
<seg id="4">He also took the BBC Music Awards, claiming plagiarism Brits awards</seg>
<seg id="5">Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not the original</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classics FM, said a senior lawmaker, putting pressure on the post to prove that doing something that commercial broadcasters are not.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has also sent the heads of the BBC as a public radio station "prosteste" and increasingly resembles the commercial adversary.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I have the impression that Radio 3" prosteste "- although I do not like to use the word - but I have the impression that turns into Classics FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also took the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, the Brits seem to be under another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, if you are trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only serve to duplicate what already exists in the market, "said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">The director general of the BBC has denied the allegations, saying the BBC Radio 3 is far in front of his opponent in the live music business and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">I will not learn anything about classical music to hear on Radio 3.</seg>
<seg id="14">And its commitment to live music and production has no rival.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In addition, I think it is also important to Radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new plays," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the first part of this year, the editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that we need to work harder to attract an audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Radio 3 was not the only thing under the banner of the BBC criticised the committee meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport because it would go in the footsteps of its trade rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the show of talent bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">You understand why there are often discussions about the issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the show made by BBC1 - with the Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - to be done "in a manner specific to the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the corporation "to find the chicken with golden eggs in their own backyard," next time launches an entertainment show.</seg>

<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are cut, the latest figures showing an increase of just 7% in the first three months of the year 2015.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and we go back to 2000, there was always a tendency streamlined over time," said Andy Mulcahy, an editor at IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.</seg>

<seg id="14">The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, it is listed as one of the reasons for falling sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the opinion of the specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to the computers to put their hands on bids, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were beaten on bargains, could prompt reluctant buyers.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently through online shops.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to use fashion stores in commercial areas.</seg>

<seg id="1">The advantages and disadvantages of conversion loans in Swiss francs</seg>
<seg id="2">The banking market has already had two offers of conversion in lions of loans in Swiss francs, the main benefit being excluding currency risk and rates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of conversion franc loans granted by Volksbank and Post Bank announced the offer of conversion for their clients.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the cumulative data from analysts financial portal FinZoom, Post Bank offers three-year fixed rate at lions, 1.5%, the lowest in the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, the conversion of the Bank's offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive cuts: Reduced balance with the value of risk and management fees paid by the client, then applied a further reduction of 22.5% to balance the lions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both offers reduced rates to their customers, as well as the monthly pay equivalent in lei before the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate of 42.5%, while the Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, with 18 per cent in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Benefits for</seg>
<seg id="10">The main advantage of the lions covresiei credit in CHF is that it eliminates the currency risk, the consumer being protected from future increases of Francs, and the mortgage repayment will be made in the currency in which they collect salary.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that there is a reassessment of the property, is no longer require additional guarantees and another proof of income.</seg>
<seg id="12">Basically, it will not make a new legal and financial analysis of the credit and will be additional costs as in the case of a refinantari.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, both banks offer to reduce the monthly rate, compared to how much customers were paying before the conversion, equivalent in lei.</seg>
<seg id="14">Risks of</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is that the rate of childhood is made up more of the interest and very little customer repaying the principal.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Post Bank offer very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Do not know how it will turn out that rate after three years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so the total, and cutting costs is lower.</seg>
<seg id="19">A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rate, is that the ROBOR index to rise significantly in the coming years (more than Libor index - CHF).</seg>
<seg id="20">For example ROBOR three months is now 1.44 per cent, but in 2013 reached the value of 6% in 2009 to more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 exceeded 40%!</seg>

<seg id="2">The world atinteste its gaze towards meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, slightly more than half who last week thought the decision would be made, I think now that the situation will keep for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current 0-0.25%.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed has brought rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could drop to zero rate and to initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy has evolved relatively well, the recovery of trillions of dollars in stock and generating a low level of inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the Fed should not ignore the global situation less rosy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after I saw the England squad for the tournament, do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not eliminate any version of away victories.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maybe Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the thorn in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be burdened by the in 2012 but will have a positive attitude and youthful.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Similar subjects: Adam Lyth has left the England team for the Test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">Obviously, as his coach of Yorkshire, I find it difficult to look at the decision not to select him on Adam Lyth in the team.</seg>
<seg id="8">He played seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the ads have been made since - and I have said it before - the players are their own selectioneri.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth and would have extended the run but his fate is in his hands.</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope that if you do more run workshops for Yorkshire will have other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Head coach of England, Bayliss, praised the attitude even when the performance was not commensurate with his ability and I am not surprised by this; above all, he is a man of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is hard to answer the question of how long is noticed a batsman in Test matches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven-run - and Sam Robson ahead to - while Nick Compton had nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton had luck at home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only complaint you can have was that England had preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but the missed opportunity is a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">The team comes Alex Hales, a batsman whom cotez very well.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a cricket player who has the "X Factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge pitch.</seg>
<seg id="19">Should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea that Moeen was launched to open at the neck with Cook, which could lead to extrajudicial spinner while preserving the four quicks, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a aruncator could not hit there and this clumsy player has already demonstrated that he is damned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe Moeen has not brought success in his district, Worcestershire, was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old colleague team, Justin Langer, played his first 38 38 test matches that first drop before entering open in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He immediately deleted three centuries and has not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the team as back-up spinner and, although I have had limited contact with him, to me that is a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may judge his young age - with an average of 31 to 35 and firing the ball - and believes it could punt, but there is not a lot of selectionerii spinneri and opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">Will learn a lot from this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="28">England has made some changes in the team of coaches.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as consultant for Test matches could be a blow to the master.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes to White-Ball to the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.</seg>
<seg id="32">I have always believed that he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela, has intuition.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if you send messages that have been sent previously, can bring fresh air into the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">Durham Colly's teammate, Ben Stokes is odihneste for one-day matches, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">While not all agree, the coaches and selectionerii does not make the program.</seg>
<seg id="36">And we should note, the jobs of the players depend on the results you get.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken never easy.</seg>

<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain has not achieved anything of value in the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know on their skin as acaparatoare may be Fleet Street and how skeptics are the media barons who are sceptical about the EU, because they have not participated in the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn who has ratified our entry in 1973 in 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">Can vaguely remember of Boris Johnson, Euro-oportunistul, who became famous in the early 1990s when it was corespodent of Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="19">ED Miliband knew their enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included the mix of pungasi neplatitori taxes, foreign phone fraudau and pseudo-Domi who hold most of the major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair will see about as though he realised that when you're locked in a doghouse with a gorila skittish, we need to give them bananas to distract from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to the idea of Cameron's referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.</seg>
<seg id="23">The media has not forgiven for that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Jeremy Corbyn, who was a friend, hit back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be in danger from egg to adopt the strategy to boycott Murdoch of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It can take time, but we need to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC's holiday on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official stance towards Europe is what I would call with gentle evolution.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most of those who do not agree with the "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.</seg>
<seg id="29">That said, "A Hilary Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when the cercetasul he has struggled not to recognise that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a minister of the "shadow" financial problems was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father was fought on TV to be unfairly Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing their position in the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's struggle was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond with what McDonnell said nor what JC said colleagues and lawmakers in a private meeting Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, I was on me - the discipline and awareness messages remain important in the television era, and especially in social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right not to be given a ticket for Cameron's favour in Europe, allowing her to take good supporting Labour in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell's basic sofismul and Corbyin on membership of the EU - in line with their past anti-capitalist - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents narcisismul for small differences is a central dogma.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his sofismului on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaigning for the exit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should scupper Paris or Berlin political capital - and there are voters suspicious - for concessions to Britain when everything could be worthless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US are already pretty disappointed about the poor englezilor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cut costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum, on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health England on electronic cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the researchers, a government agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists from the editorial team of the magazine's British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet paper criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE has published the report "benchmark" last month and described him as a "comprehensive analysis of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">Some researchers have raised questions about the robustness of data and pointed fingers at the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile basis" on which he founded PHE main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their base "on solid ground or sand miscator."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">Said they expect the PHE claims that the "current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, one meeting attended by 12 people led to the drafting of a model of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different products that contain nicotinoid; the results of this meeting were shown briefly in a research paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and his Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director has said that it would be in the past received funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also validated the accreditation of BAT in Public Health in a report on sustainability, he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the financing that there are reports that he had received from the producer of cigarettes and tobacco company Philip Morris International.</seg>
<seg id="14">Have not provided the arguments on the basis of which were selected panelului members but they include several "fruntasi" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say the finance industry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control at PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research group developed it whitewashes "conclusively" that the lack of "solid evidence on the detrimental effect it has most products under the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health at PHE, says it has responded in the past to the claims in the BMJ.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One of the two people who have smoked all her life loses his life because of this defect.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by e-cigarettes for health are minor in comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information and those who do not stem from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the NHS from smoking to reach 2 billion pounds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Expressing clear current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without its risks, it is only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - our national debt.</seg>

<seg id="23">"They have done a great job helping us to increase interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action to ensure that the devices of torture are not illegally sold and delivered to the door.</seg>

<seg id="1">Violinist David Grimal: Bach's era there were no world tours.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, artists and trade representatives.</seg>
<seg id="3">French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as little as well as the initiator of a less familiar, downright "weird," as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra composed of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a repertoire simfonic without a conductor, and that makes it to be at least a curiosity in the classic musical landscape.</seg>
<seg id="4">Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: A performance on Sunday, in which little was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the spotlight was cellist Xavier Phillips, the compound works by Enescu as nelipsite.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both performances, held on stage Ateneului, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.</seg>
<seg id="6">Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time, the only classical music as a whole in which there is not a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conductor is the most important musician for musicians.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is true, on the one hand the musicians need an education or to become soloists, either to become performers in an orchestra - speak instrumentisti, not composers.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are trained as "specialist workers."</seg>
<seg id="10">They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other side of the scene, to the public, all musical fetisizarea focuses on the conductor.</seg>
<seg id="12">And so, businessul, the music industry, is its marketing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, no longer talking about the music.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, if you look at this world, we have the skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but we need to look at, and what is stupid, "believes David Grimal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Violinist describes this change in the way that makes the music came from the musical "disillusionment" in his career.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to earn money and to bring the money and the music industry.</seg>
<seg id="17">10 years ago, when I was around 30 years ago, I found it very depressing, because no longer 'creativity and human fraternity in this system.</seg>
<seg id="18">So, I have not found any connection to continue on this path.</seg>
<seg id="19">So I decided to create Les Dissonances.</seg>
<seg id="20">This happens in 2004, and at the time nobody was doing it without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."</seg>
<seg id="21">"As you can imagine to do marketing with a collective of musicians in which no more ego?" Asks the artist.</seg>
<seg id="22">David Grimal admits Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury," saying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in his music: "Curiously, sings a more complex repertoire, so it seems easier, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the work and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding that Sunday's performance was "74 conductors on stage."</seg>
<seg id="24">In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is "very courageous," precisely because he invited and Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where are the greatest orchestras in the world who sings and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited and this strange group."</seg>
<seg id="25">In a temple of orchestrale tradition, as is the Enescu Festival, there is the place and the interest for something different that breaks barriers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Speaking about the work of Enescu, Romanian violinist admits he feels the music of the famous Romanian composer, so did not need a special approach when he introduced the Enescu works in his repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="27">Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk of George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made the French music."</seg>
<seg id="28">Grimal is committed to changing how it makes classical music education, believing that "the profession of musician, as it is called today, has a flavour of death" and that "the future of music is the music itself."</seg>
<seg id="29">We do not need to do the rounds of the world 5 times a year if it does not serve at all.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the era of Bach there were no world tours.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who work, who were artists and not trade representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">For me, holding concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albumelor, all are tremendous, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.</seg>
<seg id="33">If not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, no longer has freedom.</seg>
<seg id="34">To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of the Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before we enter the EU, had good meat and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="35">In order to enter the EU had to adopt sanitary laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.</seg>
<seg id="36">Production and agriculture are in the supermarkets, as is the case in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">The music is the same thing, it's the same logic.</seg>
<seg id="38">Les Dissonances red is perhaps not too nice, but when they cut the tomatoes are true.</seg>
<seg id="39">In an ideal world, should this music to return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music doesn't need to be sold, but it needs to be shared, and this can be done from the educational policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If I believe - as do the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his learning in school, we reintroduce the concerts on TV and through this education would no longer be required to sell music by-products," Grimal believes.</seg>
<seg id="41">Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarised.</seg>
<seg id="42">It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if they form a musician who will play an instrument, and, above all, the musician.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, is something else entirely.</seg>
<seg id="44">After your parearea, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks the French artist smiling.</seg>
<seg id="45">Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of a different kind of music comes from overcoming this status of "soldier," overcoming what they believe are the "limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert come out smiling."</seg>
<seg id="46">David Grimal spoke about his musical project and about his music and the artist in the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the public held at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.</seg>
<seg id="47">David Grimal profile</seg>
<seg id="48">Having followed the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from some renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal has studied for a year at the Ecole Polytechnique des Science Politiques in Paris ahead of a meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who later changed his life.</seg>
<seg id="49">David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which gave regular concerts in the last 20 years on the main stages of the world's classical music and with prestigious orchestras such as Orchestras Paris, Orchestras Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Lyon National Orchestras, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, Orchestras l Opera de Lyon, the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Warsaw Sinfonia, under the leadership of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schￃnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruￌhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.</seg>

<seg id="51">In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal has been keen to explore and more personal projects.</seg>
<seg id="52">The freedom that gave him a collaboration with Les Dissonances has enabled him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertorii which are not accessible to solo artists.</seg>
<seg id="53">Along with Les Dissonances, founded the "L Autre Saison," a series of concerts in benefit and with the homeless at the church of Saint-lion, located in the heart of Paris.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most anticipated meetings in recent years, with policy makers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a table of Honduran mahon with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Above their heads, at one end of the hall of the central bank, will glimpse a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is intended to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chairman, and his colleagues have to put the economic interests of the nation above all else.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: To maximise the rate of employment in the US and to maintain price stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third pregnancy could be the X factor in a decision is too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and that will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dezbarata of unprecedented stimulus provided by short-term interest rate near zero in place since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if the majority of the data indicates a strong growth in the economy, the recent global financial markets could scare off the Fed officials are already wary about adding volatility by increasing the benchmark federal funds rate - even with a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues we will be watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, rising uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus regarding the decision that we will take the Fed, this in itself causing instability in the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted a rise in interest rates this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.</seg>
<seg id="13">This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, except where those developing policies would cushion the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next boom.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The momentum was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be surprising that the Fed to raise interest rates at this time," Lonski said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the Fed decision makers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts have said that an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to increase the rate of 0.25 per cent this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of US recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said in the spring and early summer that was expecting an interest rate rise this year despite the objections of liberals as that would need more economic progress.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation has slowed in August, the labour market growth has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level of the Fed believed that full employment of labour.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains showed signs of growth.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation has continued to achieve the annual goal of the central bank, Fed policy makers have said that a key reason was a temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The economy can withstand higher rates and needs them, given the tension of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the global financial markets have begun to enter fibrilatii later this month, after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 per cent below the record peak reached in May, as investors have feared that the slowing Chinese economy will drag down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market reculat somewhat this month, the Dow is now about 10% below the peak in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed decision makers, the market is added to the complex calculation of the timing of rising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Without what happened in financial markets and the news about the Chinese economy weakened in recent weeks, it would be the strongest in a meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with expertise in the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he expected to wait at least a month in order to better manage the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data on which to base subsequent events in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">When the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so that basically should not be taken into account in making decisions.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority in the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, the central bank's influence was huge.</seg>
<seg id="36">Simple reminder of the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are twinned with more and more, it is expected that Fed officials not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet, Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Please., said this month that "the Fed has a history of bloated reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have no connection with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the body with decision-making role, which has supported the increase in the interest rate, provided that such decisions in 1998-99.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut its benchmark rate to 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite the possibility of identification with limited implications for the development of the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials have reversed their respective scaderilor.</seg>
<seg id="43">EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in case of a major crisis, such as the earthquake was on the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate setting committee at the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">Last turbulent period not long at that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Certainly we don't want to get into fears of a rise in interest rates because the markets have been upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve still holds dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability and, until will change anything in this regard, I don't think we should take action prematurely.</seg>

<seg id="1">Weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of easy diabeticilor with obesity</seg>
<seg id="2">Chirurgiei benefits of reducing weight in the case of people with obesity, type 2 diabetes with zaharat could keep for at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether the easy diabeticii with obesity live longer after surgical intervention for weight loss than those who follow nechirurgicale treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It takes a long time to centralise the data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, the car she wrote an article about the new study in Jama Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">For weight loss surgery, surgery and called bariatrica, using various methods to reduce stomacul.</seg>
<seg id="6">This reduces the feeling of hunger and limits the ability of the body to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatrica surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes zaharat, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index of 35 or higher (IMC).</seg>
<seg id="8">IMC, a measure of weight in relation to the match, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with IMC over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate the IMC accesand: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected since 2007 in a trial in which compares two types of bariatrica surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomie in Shirley - in the medical treatment of zaharat type 2 diabetes in people with obesity.</seg>
<seg id="12">IMC environment for people who have undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year as part of the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the IMC who received nechirurgicale treatments against diabetes zaharat remained almost at the same level, which is 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who have undergone surgery, diabetes zaharat has completely healed at 36% and partly to 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes zaharat was completely healed at only 1% and partly to just 2% of respondents.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the control tension arteriale, trigliceridele and LDL "bad" cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors concluded.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the level of sanguin hemoglobinei A1c, which reflects the glicemiei level over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobinei A1c is below 7%.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgical intervention, the average A1c hemoglobinei has dropped from around 9% to around 6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in the group treated by medical methods, stood at about 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this "improved glicemic control" - reflected the improved levels of A1c hemoglobinei - have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng HSU and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In its fifth year, compared with the group with gastrectomie in Shirley, the surgery group having lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had more severe decline in the value of IMC (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobinei A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and showed a higher probability of complete diabetes remisiune zaharat (46.9% to 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone surgery bariatrica showed a probability of about 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is optimistic for people with IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the point at which this work is critical, because it says that this surgery is safe in the group with low IMC," without increasing the risk of death or illness renala, she says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -sa takes weight seriously then the IMC's patient reaches 27-30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we expect too much to urge people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have scurtcircuitat predispunandu bodies them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely hard to get back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will look like a man is sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If that happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a room for observers from the floor of the prison's execution of Oklahoma and I will see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of the four witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation came first in January, with the best friend of his, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.</seg>
<seg id="6">As we get closer to the day, I purport the idea.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, as usual requests exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those elected will watch the execution with impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">I sit next to his closest friends of Richard Glossip, in addition I have developed my own contact with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours and a half.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the type.</seg>
<seg id="16">Radem often much when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prison authorities say they cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not allow myself to have a carnetel and a pix to note what they see.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that compromising my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Detainee tells the story as he wants, to get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">He acknowledged that "could have been a better formula," but is still think are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="25">I cannot tell you what to write, and I would not do it even if I'd asked.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that I can remove from the list of witnesses ever.</seg>
<seg id="27">But wants to be present an international report that to write about the subject.</seg>
<seg id="28">Believes that, if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to hear more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that I have done.</seg>
<seg id="31">I will not come back here on all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I think it is very likely to be not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I strongly believe that there were not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="36">I think the execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And I will watch dying from this perspective.</seg>
<seg id="38">I can't pretend that I am totally objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.</seg>
<seg id="40">From me, you will know how it is to watch a man like him dying needlessly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, to answer their opponents in allegations of wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, called the criticism of placare tactics used by his team as "distorted" issues raised by the two main favourites in the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees have allowed the Storm players to "take them to grips" team in the match won by Storm nervous in the final qualifier on Friday evening in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Brisbane Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North www.wfdeaf.org Cowboys, played on Saturday evening, when he called the game a "demonstration" of rugby league and said that the two teams from www.wfdeaf.org luminaries are not in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy jumped in to defend the tactics of placare addressed by his team and said the players were simply "touch" when placau.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches have criticised the team, meaning that they were worried that the storm will prevail.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And it gets worse - I have not heard Trent Robinson to complain of wrestling when we were beaten with the score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, just as much as in the last six weeks we have really put emphasis on contact in placari and so I changed the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is in office for three years and obviously has a great team, so perhaps that is not used to losing, and it was a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nostim as always happens at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has contradicted the idea of Bennett's "Francophone football," reminding mentorului or St George-Illawarra Dragons's Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing football "boring."</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks about the thrilling football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He argued comparandu view their game on Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how thrilling was the game, "said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that, in 2010, St George has received a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he was not interested in either as black under unghie.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now has a team that can play what I see as thrilling football, particularly young mijlocasilor manoeuvering.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the kind of game you want to do when you have such players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two mijlocasi as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.</seg>
<seg id="18">It gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat worried about the match with us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now six weeks were probably not to us when we were in big matches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy has also highlighted the fact that the match between the Storm and Roosters was a stiffer race tied the score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game against the Broncos was probably a good game, we have not yet seen, as was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two attempts, that means thrilling game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or thrilling means to get the breaks and not marchezi?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me are the plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">If we talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">Storm is free this weekend because they have earned the right to play at home or with North www.wfdeaf.org Cowboys, with the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminariilor final next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday, in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: The comedy series that has taught us important lessons about friendship between men</seg>
<seg id="2">Similar personajelor absence in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, the rates of suicide among young men reaching the peak of the last 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign against the unfortunate life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) has designated 2015 as the Year Barbatului, wanting to question the culture that prevents men seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight to the success of this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by many friends enough "with a healthy mood," his chances of catching doubles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Similarly, for those who are not deprimate, a circle of friends mentally healthy to halve the probability of mental disorders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of course, that friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate response is often the priority before contact with meaning.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personalities, open to fun and successful, even though in reality it is the isolation that prevails.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call the extrinseci values; money, image, social status, all the cost of the intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - and more deeply affecting our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">Aul billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money does not buy happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of the series Friends was that the attention to this idea.</seg>
<seg id="14">The characters were not defined by the workplace but its own personality, which showed by interacting as friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">Joey's frequent imbratisarilor humor and Somali, when they watch the cushy seats and Ross's passion for Chandler came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if it often shrugs off to completely explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As I explained a social worker: "... my job is to listen to people with the trend of suicide and deprimate showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often, the people who come to us do not feel able to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage that one can is strong, as well as the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about the problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the series that come to mind when I try to give more mechanisms of long-term psychological adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The show has highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.</seg>
<seg id="21">No matter how much help the objective intervention, outside, via telephone, people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest staged comedy Central, restoring full platourilor film to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over coffee at Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smiling and you welcome.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what a difference it could make your friendship.</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to assert itself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will continue to chronicle the game and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain from the series matches in the Champions League groups, with a reassuring victory 2-0 against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on the Park des Princes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored in less than four minutes at the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions ahead although they missed a number of occasions before securing the advantage with Cavani's goal he scored in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Group A along with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not the only qualification for the next round but also an improvement in the journey towards the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, although they have taken the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity gap after that was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club and began his brilliant career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 victory they create problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable margin over the runners, even if there are issues that we need to improve throughout the season," Blanc says.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and I did it, although I am sorry that I failed to give one or two goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic has returned after injuring at one of three changes to the team in Paris, with a station 2-2 achieved at home to Bordeaux in the League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last month, when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and has demonstrated this when he tasnit on Marco Verratti's pass behind the defence of Malmo before suteze incredible over Johan Wiland, long in the right corner of the goal.</seg>
<seg id="14">But if anyone expected that PSG pocnind off the fingers, they were disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with the new holders of the national teams, with a defence of five people and two mijlocasi defensivi, was a strong contender.</seg>
<seg id="16">But their attack was not impressive, the exception-Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, the PSG players have slowed several times, giving a few passes and nefinalizand interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half and was replaced by Cavani then even after the resumption of play.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ibrahimovic has proved far more skilled in support of his colleagues, his care being the one that Di Maria has sent a shot diverted by Wiland over the door in the 52nd minute.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal was scored in a final after over an hour of the match, because of Cavani, uruguayanul who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic batting from Maxwell's centrarea.</seg>
<seg id="20">This gap has eliminated the hope in Malmo that will rebalance the score and only a superb stop Wiland's remotely for rejecting David Luiz has kept the final score before new intratului Ezequiel Lavezzi to cancel a goal in stoppage time.</seg>
<seg id="21">Norwegian coach of the team in Malmo, Age Hareide, said afterwards that PSG were a class above, and that "The game we have played in the Champions League was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which is not up to the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Qualifications are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off for PSG.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have made an excellent game.</seg>

<seg id="2">The culture of the House committees on Wednesday rejected the report of the Governing Council of the Romanian Society of Television in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">For rejecting the report have voted 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices together.</seg>

<seg id="7">"I think in light of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the culture of the Senate, Georgica Severin.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that it was "common sense" as the leadership of TVR to be present at this meeting, while the Commissions culture was not present any representative of the TVR.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was good to be present at TVR because nobody here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The invitation was made by CA members since last night, with an approximate time that he did not know any new hour, but today, after the joint Offices, I sent a fax to the leadership of TVR inviting her.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think when you're called, you as a government employee, paid for by public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint committees even if you do not like it.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Because it is your obligation service, you're in an institution in charge of the House," said Severin after the joint Committees of Parliament's culture.</seg>
<seg id="13">He added that the meeting were discussed the financial aspects of the institution on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.</seg>
<seg id="14">The debts we saw ourselves as continued, came up with the idea that this year would be the day, but have not been paid from the historical ones.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I remind you that it's not my fault or anyone else in these committees has lost that pleasure with the banks and fiscul, are clear management problems," Severin said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting will follow the elections for a new administration, and he will choose the general director of the institution.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't know who will be proposed for this post.</seg>
<seg id="18">Miracles will not do.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is important to take political decisions for this institution to function.</seg>
<seg id="20">I am not a man to lie, to tell you that there will be a genius who will sit in the queue here and it will be blowing.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that those who decide, the House of Parliament, through their vote to choose the very reason people who will lead the TVR.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be people who know what is happening there, to have the experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.</seg>
<seg id="23">I don't know who will be, if you ask me what qualities should have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a maldar petitions that come from employees, complaints, redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="24">"When you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and talk about the financial situation is a disaster," concluded the President of the Commission of culture in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although it was not presented to Parliament, president-general manager of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, which calls for Parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to salvation and securing economic and political independence of public television, including the TV tax.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the letter, Stelian Tanase calls, in addition to the TV tax, amending and supplementing HG 978 / 2003 on the fee for public service television, in the sense of updating the technological change in the day, as well as for regulating the procedure on control of pay TV tax and to finding and applying sanctions and penalties.</seg>
<seg id="27">It also wants the release of a provision that would extend the requirement for all electricity suppliers to become mandatari SRTv for collections of TV by ANRE involvement in regulating this activity.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his view, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of 5% of maximal comisionului in receipts.</seg>
<seg id="29">Stelian Tanase calls for reducing the VAT rate for specific activities, public television and the CNC from 15% to 3%, but changing the law 41 / 1994, meaning the possibility of receiving budget allocations / financing for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.</seg>
<seg id="30">He claims SRTv will go into default in the coming months given that the labour law obliges the employer to the enforcement of judgments, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.</seg>
<seg id="31">TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So were reduced trips and other activities generating costs, were renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and in late July as TVR News was closed," reads the letter to President TVR.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tanase appreciates that the dire financial situation cannot be remedied only through their own efforts.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Without the support of state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Romanian Television will, sooner or later, unable to fulfill their public mission," the letter states.</seg>
<seg id="35">The leadership of the House of Deputies decided to send the letter to the culture.</seg>

<seg id="8">"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!," Ponta said on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Romanian Prime Minister added that is rational and sustainable solutions for the refugee crisis, acknowledging that the brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality certainly will not solve the problem - only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!</seg>
<seg id="11">"I believe in solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in complete contradiction with just these goals and values!," stressed the head of the Romanian executive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, described as "mere lies" remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, acknowledging that those claims are unsuitable for a leader in the 21st century, according to MTI.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted on Tuesday that "extremist remarks and false," the Romanian prime minister of internal political crisis in Romania and Budapest said it expects an apology from the Romanian side.</seg>
<seg id="14">Szijjarto was referring to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.</seg>
<seg id="15">What I said and I always say is that I am against the idea of xenophobic rhetoric to close the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are in the Middle Ages and I am totally opposed to this approach.</seg>
<seg id="16">If we can get more, we get it, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat those people as people, not how they treat our neighbours Hungarians, with the bat and inseriatul.</seg>
<seg id="17">"What I do not agree with," said the head of the Romanian executive, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest decided to start preparing the ground for the expansion on the border with Romania, which is building a fence on the border with Serbia, to cope with a possible change to the route used by migrants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence does not solve anything in the refugee problem and "Hungary out of Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1">In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a legitimate strategy, but then you're not asking to be treated as the seventh largest country in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the College and director of the Romanian Center for European Policies.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the police simply means they will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that come with these people."</seg>
<seg id="5">But there are masses who have started and we cannot return to history.</seg>
<seg id="6">Migration is a reality that we have to adapt as well and to adapt them to us.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which the politicians feel the need to show muscles.</seg>
<seg id="8">After he goes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now an animal created in another era, and which was not adapted to the situation now."</seg>
<seg id="9">Where we are in the refugee crisis after the JHA Council which, in fact, has not solved anything?</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.</seg>
<seg id="11">The forecast for the all saying that would have had the necessary votes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JHA applies the principle of unanimity and any state can block any decision.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, things were very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Lisbon, apply to the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves with a vote of 55% of the states, or 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.</seg>
<seg id="15">Calculations were saying that the votes were there.</seg>
<seg id="16">But didn't want to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because it is a sensitive issue, there were even rejection reactions in Germany against the policy of opening up Chancellor Merkel and did not want to appear in many countries as a response of 'we send EU migrants per head. "</seg>
<seg id="18">So were postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and is likely to see big changes there in the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="19">So mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the topic was only allowed to be cool?</seg>
<seg id="20">Yes, on the other hand, there is talk about the greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external borders of the Schengen community responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="21">Greece's border with Turkey and Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants given the limits of the old Schengen system.</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe they will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which the first time, because it's not sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="23">If Greece capoteaza, you can't say forever that is Greece's job.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is common.</seg>
<seg id="25">Precisely because the problem is common, it is possible to resolve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, for sharing the effort?</seg>
<seg id="26">No one knows exactly how they will operate mandatory quotas, if it will reach them.</seg>
<seg id="27">It remains a question: What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?</seg>
<seg id="28">I don't think it will clutch the European states to take up the migrants: You go in country X or Y. country</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps it will reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where to process asylum applications.</seg>
<seg id="30">Are working on solutions like this.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the problem is not a simple solution.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are countries who have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the issue of migrants will increase hate mainstream.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who sit in precarious camps and who have just started to go to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="34">One estimate says that only 10% have got to go, winter is over the Mediterranean, but we expect the next year to a wave may be even higher.</seg>
<seg id="35">What do we do with these people?</seg>
<seg id="36">My Pronosticul is that we get used to this problem, we will not look so catastrophic in terms of media.</seg>
<seg id="37">Vorbeati countries with less experience or higher.</seg>
<seg id="38">Do you find that there is any place where he really managed the integration of large groups from a extraeuropeana culture?</seg>
<seg id="39">I look at magrebieni in France, Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would not go to the radical statements.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sure that their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.</seg>
<seg id="42">Remained part of neintegrata that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="43">But simply means politiensti will not work.</seg>
<seg id="44">To create fortress Europe is delusional.</seg>
<seg id="45">We have fiddled with the mechanisms of integration into European societies.</seg>
<seg id="46">There have been some mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="47">We need to be more demanding.</seg>
<seg id="48">To ask those people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, and the rest of the family including the marriages of convenience.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have separated but the imminent problem of these people long-term problem of their integration.</seg>
<seg id="50">If others have failed in the long-term integration does not mean that we need to look at how they are drowning in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="51">Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that come with these people.</seg>
<seg id="52">And if an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, does not mean that it will restore the country overnight and you can bring them back.</seg>
<seg id="53">Up to defend the solutions, see fortress within Europe.</seg>
<seg id="54">Closed borders, building walls, to reintroduce border controls in the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="55">The European project is in jeopardy?</seg>
<seg id="56">The European project as such, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was built quite minimal and aranjand rules so that the pressure was too much on the countries that put the foot for the first time these migrants.</seg>
<seg id="58">I.e. we travel freely around there, but each is with his problems.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the face of such a wave cannot be so, because some countries do not face.</seg>
<seg id="60">When there are such waves of emotion, the politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long term doesn't change much.</seg>
<seg id="61">After the attacks in France do not have a more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.</seg>
<seg id="62">It is a wave of public excitement that is both ways.</seg>
<seg id="63">And it is so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on them.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have a lot of talking, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virili.</seg>
<seg id="65">And, then, the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion is emotioneaza.</seg>
<seg id="66">After going public excitement, we go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for the goods.</seg>
<seg id="67">This is the real European single market.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I don't think the Europeans would give up this principle of libertatatii movement.</seg>
<seg id="69">There will be other rules is something else.</seg>
<seg id="70">Schengen is now an animal created in another era, and which was not adapted to the situation now.</seg>
<seg id="71">Romania has played so far in this crisis?</seg>
<seg id="72">As a small country, who believes that, if the cap draw eyes and ears potholes, the theme disappears.</seg>
<seg id="73">The reality of the flows of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or zici that is not your problem of small country.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you're not asking to be treated as the seventh largest country in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="75">You are not, don't play at the big country.</seg>
<seg id="76">The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not their quality.</seg>
<seg id="77">As he did in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="78">On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians' appetite for Schengen will fall very much.</seg>
<seg id="79">President Iohannis says it may well not have already entered.</seg>
<seg id="80">So move from despair coming to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.</seg>
<seg id="81">There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.</seg>
<seg id="82">What does not mean that it is a reason not to enter the Schengen area, but to be more pragmatic.</seg>
<seg id="83">Romania will be part of Schengen, Schengen and there will be, but in the sense in which the external borders will become common responsibility, will be the single rules for migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries deemed safe.</seg>
<seg id="84">The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention on Syria in Ukraine has never killed anyone.</seg>
<seg id="85">There is a link between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?</seg>
<seg id="86">Russia has the power frustrated behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="87">She believes to be the great power means to incurci Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.</seg>
<seg id="89">Without the financial and military effort of the Putin regime, perhaps that the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.</seg>
<seg id="90">And it was good to fall before his main opponent to be Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="91">A couple of years ago was a fight between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, backed by Western and Gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="92">He then raised the Islamic State and now no longer know if the Assad regime to fall.</seg>
<seg id="93">Russia was able to complicate things, but could not participate in the solution.</seg>
<seg id="94">It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that can shut down.</seg>
<seg id="95">But you're only if you have great power and solutions.</seg>
<seg id="96">The game off-Side is just a strategy to gain time.</seg>
<seg id="97">Perhaps Putin expects to make bids, to press him on butoane to resolve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="98">Bids do not come because the world is not convinced that he can resolve in one way or another issue he ever created.</seg>
<seg id="99">But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are the invisible hand.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not to see him on a little stronger than it is.</seg>

<seg id="2">Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network representatives are preparing another, the "Dislike."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zuckerberg has said that the "Dislike" button will show more of a whiff of what feels a user than a simple option.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, his announcement has raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike."</seg>
<seg id="7">Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not very comfortable for people to "Like" of current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the opinion of the president FRH, Alexander Dedu, Romania can host a major handbalistica competition only in 2024, and the women's handball team preparing for qualification for the Olympics cost a fortune.</seg>
<seg id="3">Romanian Federation of Handball, Alexander Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the media, that it is a great pride in the fact that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.</seg>
<seg id="4">In terms of the national handball team of Romania, "the main goal is qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio, but it must pass two stages of pitchfork caudine, first World Championship and the second pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.</seg>
<seg id="5">We want very much to qualify for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are some fantastic requirements from technical stafului led by Tomas Ryde.</seg>
<seg id="7">Staf will be composed of seven or eight people.</seg>
<seg id="8">He wants second coach, a doctor, two masori, portari trainer, physical preparator, head of the delegation.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have asked for some qualifications, specifically materials for physical training, which I have never heard.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's all to reach Olimpice. Games and I will do everything for me to have them.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a massive investment, there are many, many money.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that is the way to make the performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with the preparation.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The teams that we do have these materials and have for some time," said Dedu, who noted that trying to get the amount needed to purchase these products from a protracted and COSR.</seg>
<seg id="15">The president referred to the FRH and infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country to host a major handball competition.</seg>
<seg id="16">We have no room in Bucharest.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is a matter of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned a gym Championship.</seg>
<seg id="18">Let's not forget that in other corners of the world have been built Olympic neighbourhoods entirely within two years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before 1992, the current Barcelona Olympic area was a garbage dump, and now it has reached a milestone of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="20">The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success and in terms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In my view, in 2024 able to host a major competition," Dedu said.</seg>
<seg id="22">He added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.</seg>
<seg id="23">For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Gatu went to civilisation with a project, people have given their agreement in principle, but it was clear very quickly that it will never build the hall.</seg>

<seg id="3">The trial of seven rapists in Vaslui moved, yesterday, the Court of Appeal Iasi.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ieseni have tried the first trial in a nepublica session in which seven young men accused of being taunted an 18-year-old girl had asked to be released.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the actual start of the trial, one of the judges who had been assigned the ieseni, Viorel Munteanu, has made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues on the court.</seg>

<seg id="8">Previously, the file has formulated an abstention and Judge Dan ­ Year tuna, on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship outside of wedlock with one of the attorneys for rapists.</seg>

<seg id="1">The big migrations</seg>
<seg id="2">Romania is not and will not be ready for what will follow.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Europe?</seg>
<seg id="4">I say this from the outset, loud and clear: Either the 7,000 refugees who should and must naturalise Romania is, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison with the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.</seg>
<seg id="5">For Romania, even the proposed voluntary quota of Bucharest, amount to around 1,500 occupants, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="6">Certainly, even if those migrants will accept to settle in our towns, the chances to integrate quickly in Romanian society are extraordinarily small.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.</seg>
<seg id="8">Parazitat underworld and paralysed by a political class venala, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="9">Powerlessness to integrate gypsies is just one example of banal.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to this, the governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, modern schools or kindergartens, to ensure a decent healthcare, to collect the mess on the street, to create jobs paid respectable or to keep their own younger generation at home.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why would determine the refugees in another country that is running?</seg>
<seg id="12">But what produces great wonder is mostly hypocrisy with which it dealt with such a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="13">We first fatarnicia belicoasa of strong EU states, which are showing utmost generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then comes the pusillanimous hypocrisy of Romanians who, while millions of relatives scattered all over the world, have not yet accepted the other - the other language, different religion, different blood.</seg>
<seg id="15">Perhaps fear not to steal his careva national being.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the end, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for the departure, do not accept another destination for the brain than Germany or the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan is not war.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also, the simplistic way in which it is considered the crisis can only be mocked.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have eliminated the causes, some claim, and playing strictly on the book of political correctness, seeking peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there's peace in Romania and even more come from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to flee their country every year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Why go?</seg>
<seg id="22">In this crisis, the European Union was revealed as a construction anchilozata, torn and overcome the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Deplangeam that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but here is that neither the EU does not have any plan for the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">And improvizatiile and threats do not help anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">Then, what is more, if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romans - the right to free movement - could be raised because of the wave of refugees who cross borders with cheese?</seg>
<seg id="26">At one point, the war in Syria will end.</seg>
<seg id="27">The migrant crisis but not.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the coming decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, resource depletion etc will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially in Africa, towards a better life.</seg>
<seg id="29">With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be prepared for what will follow.</seg>

<seg id="2">At 20 years received a brave but: Biological parents</seg>
<seg id="3">Lost in the hospital in unclear circumstances, in the mists of the 1990s, when she was only two months of life, wren, bolnavioara and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year in which adoption was loosely regulated, a young ieseanca, now a girl blonda and beautiful, the other day in Iasi reunited with biological parents in a village in the county, after nearly two decades in which nobody knew anything else.</seg>
<seg id="4">Crina will these days 20 years, and her foster parents in Palermo have been thought to give their beloved daughter a brave and amazing gift: A visit to Romania in Iasi, to know the past is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The newspaper of Iasi," who assisted in the search efforts of the family home after a few clues extremely vague, he witnessed these meetings which practically sever your heart.</seg>
<seg id="6">Story reporters, moments of emotions, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="7">Crinei story starts 20 years ago in the village of ieseana Ruginoasa, when only two months.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, because of health problems, had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.</seg>
<seg id="9">Home began to misunderstandings between parents, and the mother had to parareasca domiciled.</seg>
<seg id="10">He decided to keep the girl, and me to send back home.</seg>
<seg id="11">He stopped, and then I have never known anything.</seg>
<seg id="12">"When I found out I was in the hospital, it was too late," remembers apart Alina, the girl's biological mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crina was admitted with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and also then the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their lives had to break up.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have found the Crina in hospital</seg>
<seg id="16">After internare, Crinei's father went to work in another village, and returned after six months.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to hospital in Iasi, and father, when he returned, he found her.</seg>
<seg id="18">I think trecusera nearly nine months before he was in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is believed to be abandoned," a family's granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="20">Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Crina in Iasi, and the girl was left in the care of doctors.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the care of Bucium Plasament Centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">There were years of abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bucium Centre was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple of Palermo which wanted to have their child but not managed.</seg>
<seg id="24">There have been the love of blonduta Crina, and after some time it had to move permanently with them in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="25">Little had already done nearly two years ago, how long it took the adoption formalities.</seg>
<seg id="26">When I saw the Crina, I felt that it is before us.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If my wife would have given life," says smiling Salvadore, adoptiv's father, while the catch in the palm of the hand of girl.</seg>
<seg id="28">At home, parents Crinei, Alina and Costica, continued separate searches, each on where he could.</seg>
<seg id="29">The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where he could be his child.</seg>
<seg id="30">The police then told him that it is possible to be deceased, but in Iasi parents have learned what really happened with their face.</seg>
<seg id="31">When I looked down here, they told me at the Tribunal that e plecata in Italy, Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="32">And the conditions for it to have never had.</seg>
<seg id="33">We prayed to God to be good.</seg>
<seg id="34">I thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to umblam, to find it.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's hard," tells us in tears with the biological mother Crinei.</seg>
<seg id="36">But, even if the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained the girl where it comes from and that its past a link to Romania.</seg>
<seg id="38">I was small when I found out.</seg>
<seg id="39">I think we had five or six years.</seg>
<seg id="40">I reacted as a copila, I was curious.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," confesses delighted Crina.</seg>
<seg id="42">And her dream was to become a reality.</seg>
<seg id="43">In March of this year, the chief commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Drug Enforcement Review and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crinei biological family.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the search started only from a name.</seg>
<seg id="45">After the request that we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.</seg>
<seg id="46">Primisem just a name, Balcan Costica, then the locality, Ruginoasa.</seg>
<seg id="47">Shortly after I took a job with the mayor there, and I was able to ask if there is through the village name received.</seg>
<seg id="48">Then they gave me some indications, only that the person was not found and sought.</seg>
<seg id="49">"In the end it took about a month ago up to find the girl's biological father," explains chief commissioner Romica Ichim.</seg>
<seg id="50">In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find the Costica and Alina, especially as each was living in another village.</seg>
<seg id="51">We have to start somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Then I found that in September to be held a first meeting," added Romica Ichim.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the last weekend, Alina and Costica were seen for the first time lost to walk the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="54">The father, excited, barely able to contain their tears, and hands tremurau to the hilt.</seg>
<seg id="55">Just changing a few words with those around them.</seg>
<seg id="56">A week before the meeting, nor too be able to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was all excited, tremura.</seg>
<seg id="58">"To see your child after so many years, it is something," said a granddaughter, welcome and she with Costica from Ruginoasa.</seg>
<seg id="59">Crinei meeting with her mother and brother of biological</seg>
<seg id="60">In talks with his face, which is expected to study at a university ranked well in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if he wants one day to return to his village, to come quiet: I can give some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and to conjure up a household.</seg>
<seg id="61">It's mother and her emotion complain, and hardly believe that something like this can happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="62">I am very emotionata.</seg>
<seg id="63">I thought that something like this could happen.</seg>
<seg id="64">I have seen such cases on television, I thought in all these years, I had hoped, but I thought that I could be and I like that.</seg>
<seg id="65">Are very high emotions.</seg>
<seg id="66">If I could forgive me.</seg>
<seg id="67">I hope to visit in the future.</seg>
<seg id="68">"I hope we can keep a connection," tells us with big tears on obraji Alina, Crinei mother, while keeping a tight hand servetel.</seg>
<seg id="69">As he hides his tears of happiness, because in a short time will see her face after all the bitter weather.</seg>
<seg id="70">The other side, Crina, which he will be more than just a few days, this month, 20 years ago, trying to calm down like an emotional child.</seg>
<seg id="71">Did not know what to expect, but has a vague idea about her biological parents.</seg>
<seg id="72">Believes they are young, but now before the meeting is trying to gather his thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing reproached.</seg>
<seg id="73">My parents are two mothers and two fathers.</seg>
<seg id="74">But my parents are after all those who have grown.</seg>
<seg id="75">It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," confesses Crina.</seg>
<seg id="77">The first meeting of the family in Iasi</seg>
<seg id="78">In Unirii Square, under the skies of autumn, the family of Ruginoasa again unites their destiny with their face in Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="79">Crina is now 20 years old, high school, after the Italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.</seg>
<seg id="80">Not only borders or countries, but only a barrier: The language.</seg>
<seg id="81">More than that, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in downtown Iasului, passed easily.</seg>
<seg id="82">Those who have managed to make it possible to say that it is the first event of its kind made, and that, in the future, if there is more opportunity, they still do.</seg>
<seg id="83">It is the first event of its kind held by such an emotional, and I am happy to be a success.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, at the Centre, we have different activities, and are most often associated as an institution which deals only with people consuming, drug-dependent people.</seg>
<seg id="85">But we are trying to restore the society something good back.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I will be asked for such a evenimeniment, I'll do it with a big heart," says smiling Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention, Drug Enforcement Advisory Review and Iasi.</seg>
<seg id="87">Behind him, the Balcan family, Crina in the middle, of gravitating.</seg>
<seg id="88">Understandable: They have a lot to say to each other.</seg>

<seg id="5">The party's executive chairman Presati, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats ieseni will send him a list of potential candidates for the party's functions.</seg>

<seg id="7">Dragnea has not given an ultimatum.</seg>
<seg id="8">Launched a very simple message and very present in the conditions now: Try to find a solution in order not to endanger the party.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 3 October we have elections in the party.</seg>
<seg id="10">All functions will be available to those who want them.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor, Michael Chirica.</seg>

<seg id="15">Since they could add and take comunei Schitu mayor, Mihai Mihalache.</seg>
<seg id="16">One option under consideration is the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors and the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will enter the race, party sources saying that he is not interested in the post.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former leader of the branch, the mayor Gheorghe Nichita.</seg>
<seg id="18">The list of candidates is open.</seg>
<seg id="19">Under the statute, including on election day can be submitted applications, and would not be surprised if anyone would happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Bureau and all new governance structures," Catea said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close aide and Nichita Stanciu.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29th, elections will basically be secured by the executive branch secretary, county adviser Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to a "partial consensus."</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.</seg>
<seg id="25">Has reached a consensus in part to support a unified team to deal with the county.</seg>
<seg id="26">"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions of the candidacy of the PSD Iasi, the list remains open," commented Stanciu.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seven young people from the county of Vaslui convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iasi.</seg>

<seg id="4">The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="8">Late last week, the Judecatoria Vaslui magistrate who sentenced seven young people motivated the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="9">The judge speaks in defiant reaction to the defendants, but also those who have supported him, saying that such attitudes creates a strong sense of outrage among the public.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The court finds that after the time of preemptive under judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not custodial, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, families and their local supporters, was felt throughout the local community and a strong sense of national outrage about the fact that people accused of serious facts are prosecuted under a less restrictive measure," reads the motivation Judecatoriei Vaslui.</seg>

<seg id="1">Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the past decades can no longer continue in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until Saturday, probably little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical stangist of Labour leader after the war.</seg>
<seg id="6">Marxist, anti-monarhist (asked him at one point Tony Blair, then prime minister, to the royal family of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movement Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and out of NATO and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">For Corbyn, who was considered at the time the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost better than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">The model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, the anti-austerity miracle solutions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Things like those which they said they were promised and Tsipras in Greece until the time when the chest with the real world and economic legitatile.</seg>
<seg id="10">The economic programme of the new Labour leader calls for, among other things, the massive renationalizari and printing money as a solution for funding development projects and coverage of some very generous social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sure, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not widely adopted across the globe, we then have a general prosperity world!, but who is to prevent such details.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sure, we can get those in the blood bankers, becoming a kind of service enemies on the Left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Additional amounts are quickly inghitite by generous promises, without backing, made by populist demagogues.</seg>
<seg id="14">As well the attention of Margaret Thatcher, "The problem with socialism is that at some point over the money of others."</seg>
<seg id="15">Few give Jeremy Corbyn's real chances to reach ever prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who however was not as extreme in the belief that proaspatul party leader, has failed miserably in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then there is still in Britain a muncitoreasca class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the unions were more influential sensitive now.</seg>
<seg id="19">Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the whole workforce, and extensive automatizari made in the industry to be massive need for qualified manpower, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly.</seg>
<seg id="21">In its latest Financial Times believes the number of Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, namely Britain's exit from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the bloc.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation which has imposed austerity on the poor.</seg>
<seg id="24">When combini this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right-wing, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU reach an explosive mixaj.</seg>
<seg id="25">And not just for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="26">But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the symbolic capital loss for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created inside the Euro crisis and now why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaving room for the most worrisome scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the more so for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (which anyway Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant player).</seg>
<seg id="28">Admittedly, the British business, the City, are strong advocates of the country's remaining in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Europe today is no longer in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are a lot of resentment, which are growing in intensity even in these weeks.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problem is that Brussels, we had just recently a sample in the speech of Jean Clude Junker, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States in only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="32">And what happens when the electoral support for antisistem formations, anti-immigration, which are at the same time and Eurosceptic increase dramatically across the continent.</seg>
<seg id="33">In other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo arrived at higher rates than ever before in the past.</seg>
<seg id="34">Hence the conclusion that we draw the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves the national interest.</seg>
<seg id="36">If voters decide to stroke, then Britain will remain in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="37">But Corbyn's victory reminds us the power of emotion in the current policy.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.</seg>
<seg id="39">Especially if, as is expected, we will see a greater integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and the outskirts of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="40">Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fuelling populist rhetoric of accumulated frustrations in oocidentale societies.</seg>
<seg id="41">The economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the past dozen years, generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="42">Under pressure from the explosive dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by rash decisions that have not taken into account than integrationist political ambitions, and the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the EU's internal tensions will increase in intensity and major can affect the situation of Romania.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it is difficult to excluzi something in terms of possible scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="44">The question is whether our political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantin Brancusi, farmer's god.</seg>
<seg id="2">Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"</seg>
<seg id="3">Brancusi: "Take mature and workshop!"</seg>
<seg id="4">The great sculptor had a big dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">Behind renumelui or hiding but something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered to millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.</seg>
<seg id="6">That something has a name.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is called "truda."</seg>
<seg id="8">What to write about Constantin Brancusi?</seg>
<seg id="9">What's there to say, really?</seg>
<seg id="10">His figure appeared on the banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, recently, a bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a billboard.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brancusi produces and supplies money in almost 60 years is no longer among us.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that named after him.</seg>
<seg id="14">Otherwise, even the author of this text resides on one of these streets.</seg>
<seg id="15">And, when it hits the outside with odrasla hears the following instructions: "Go into the park, Brancusi."</seg>
<seg id="16">The country is impanzita of its statues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are few Romanian personalities whose works to be known as much of the world, from children to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ability of Brancusi's infiltration is huge.</seg>
<seg id="19">Neither the Communists failed to extirpe in memory and culture of Romania.</seg>
<seg id="20">His recitations dot the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of Like and share.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, then, again, what would be said, writing about this man?</seg>
<seg id="22">Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to recreate the destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.</seg>
<seg id="23">You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven't had the good fortune to you're born in any large city and in a reasonably affluent family, your chances of success in life are almost nil.</seg>
<seg id="24">Contraexemplul Brancusi's life is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="25">And maybe there would be a key.</seg>
<seg id="26">Maybe there should be started the text that follows.</seg>
<seg id="27">With a sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.</seg>
<seg id="28">Look cretine success stories, which are delivered daily in the newspapers and on TV.</seg>
<seg id="29">A close look at figure this man.</seg>
<seg id="30">Do you want to know how to manage in life, how, today, he heard a whole globe?</seg>
<seg id="31">It is.</seg>
<seg id="32">He worked all her life to be someone.</seg>
<seg id="33">Did it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876, in Hobita, a small village in joint Pestisani, Gorj County, in the Carpathian foothills.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi leads a modest life, but one that had to collect the benchmarks that will guide the artistic vision of late.</seg>
<seg id="37">Recalling childhood and where he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, Paris, 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="38">For millennia, people duceau, happy, a patriarchal life.</seg>
<seg id="39">Everything was quiet from one season to another.</seg>
<seg id="40">And you know why things have changed?</seg>
<seg id="41">Civilisation great city came up to us.</seg>
<seg id="42">Brancusi's Copilaria was far from a bucolic.</seg>
<seg id="43">One of the moments that happened in these early years of life is very aptly for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the future sculptor years spent in his native village.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is reproducing the work "Brancusi. A biography," written by Alexander Buican.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the autumn of that year, when it was plum brandy "cazan," those who own lichidul sample to see if the process is carried out properly, Brancusi comes at a time of general inadvertently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Filling their causul palmelor with plum brandy and drink on nerasuflate.</seg>
<seg id="48">Falls in his sleep almost instantly.</seg>
<seg id="49">The first people see only after a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="50">Mother into panic, then the hysteria, believing that her son died.</seg>
<seg id="51">Later in the day, when the father, Radu, returns from vineyards accompanied by lautari, he sees in the desperate signs of those ahead of him holding their breath.</seg>
<seg id="52">The party turns immediately in jale.</seg>
<seg id="53">The father is already at ingropaciune.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, one finds that it is good to summon the Baba Brandusa, doftoroaie and servitoare Brancusilor said.</seg>
<seg id="55">Brandusa check the child's breath, then put them under the nose of the horse balega, gathered in the run.</seg>
<seg id="56">Child stranuta.</seg>
<seg id="57">World applauds.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the boy is left to sleep on betia, joy, the party with the lautari continues with more force.</seg>
<seg id="59">The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.</seg>
<seg id="60">Radu Constantin Brancusi puts him on to collect some nuiele and to bring them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The father of the child with his head down and, with nuielele brought the boy, knocking him to remember.</seg>
<seg id="62">And, while he feels usturimea blows, the tiny Brancusi is the revelation that the world can be viewed from another perspective and that things can appear around capsized.</seg>
<seg id="63">Especially the position of the sun, from the well-known, makes him wondering, as you have to admit, if not himself attend astrul's disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="64">The sun was equally disturbed that his father of what happened?.</seg>

<seg id="2">An MP is calling on politicians to remember those who have voted.</seg>
<seg id="3">Independent MP Viorel Blajut appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop the infighting and to refocus the agenda to the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we see now on our political scene is a big division and both.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have not seen anything in the USL projects in 2012 to continue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neither highway nor the Regional hospital for emergencies, you see just how politicians disputed their possible sites depending on real estate interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">To leave a little politics aside, to gather and talk.</seg>
<seg id="8">At present, the city is not working.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If you're busy with internal war, no longer have time for those who you have chosen," said Blajut.</seg>
<seg id="10">He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed iesean electorate, the consequence will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing virtually the electorate of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also, the MP believes that voters will move more towards the traditional parties, expressing reservation over the new policy initiatives, such as the party's "For Iasi" which will be launched today.</seg>
<seg id="12">The local parties have very small chance and will only break from the electorate right, not from the PSD.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Faramiteaza even further right, which is not good for anyone, neither for the PSD," said Blajut.</seg>
<seg id="15">He made it clear that he is not interested in a bid for the upcoming local elections, rumours about his intention to enroll in the mayoral race.</seg>
<seg id="16">I said that I do not want to in any local office.</seg>
<seg id="17">I am still thinking whether to continue as a member and in the future.</seg>
<seg id="18">I tried to call for unity to Iasi and talks in the corridors, with other lawmakers, and I have been accused that I want to make the picture.</seg>
<seg id="19">I do not want, but we can no longer continue.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If people voted for us, does not mean that they are fools to vote if you don't see anything," said Blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is alesilor hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="21">A colleague from Tatarasi said he does not get the money and we have to go by bus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let us not be hypocrites.</seg>
<seg id="23">Are not cheap.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sometimes I am ashamed to raise money in the kitty.</seg>
<seg id="25">The end I will make a report with everything we spent, in addition to employee salaries from the cabinet and its maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="26">Happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lions, although deconturile transport, accommodation and others.</seg>
<seg id="27">"To say an MP that does not get the money is clean hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.</seg>
