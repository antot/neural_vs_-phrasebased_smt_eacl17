<seg id="1">In an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">During the calls to the emergency line to his voice Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he shot his girlfriend, and it is necessary to come to their home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb had said that his "sweet dog" house was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts can be found on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy, and she is the only one who ever loved me," said the letter, which was signed by Lamb, according to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, drove 300 miles on a school campus, where police believe he shot the popular professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police chief in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lamb said he made the fateful phone call to emergency line shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then came another death; Lamb took his own life, when the police came for him.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to figure out what was Lamb's motivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details disclosed by investigators on the side of the state and the students and staff who knew him, and together they created the image of a talented, but probably a troubled teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared the academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">They both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, along with the other 17 members of the faculty and many students attended courses for both at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there have been inclination regarding the problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student who praised the Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he, too, seemed agitated and trembling, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he is faced with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb has previously called for the Delta State University for time off for health reasons, which stated that he has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">And this year, only two online courses taught.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recent changes to university recruitment meant that a doctorate in which Lamb worked hard, he would not guarantee automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University president William LaForge said that he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr Lamb seems to be worried about something."</seg>
<seg id="22">To answer these questions, we have Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="23">After he left the campus, the police picked up his trail, he crossed the border state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, Lamb jedinýmvýstřelem killed himself with a pistol in the courtyard of a house about a mile from their parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, the coroner confirmed the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">Left the car running on the street.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to the house, although Johnson said she probably knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in this country.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of training.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the spring has a doctorate in education.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the longtime friends Lamb described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carl Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb, 20, when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older boy who tutored her for several years playing the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the time it was quite a heartbreaker.</seg>
<seg id="34">The heart of all the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were reportedly went for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the emergency call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of the marriage never existed.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which is adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O 'Steen, said he broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and they had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely exhausted," said O 'Steen about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She was with her mother's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="42">The 'Steen said he had met with Lamb, but through his daughter, Abigail, knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met with Prentiss, together with Abigail vystuopovali at a summer festival three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together random gigy.</seg>
<seg id="45">The 'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings his own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The julep Room, a dimly lighted bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweat, what Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign of anything wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It was just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We fooled around and recorded each other on a joke.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, killed by a professor, he led a seminar in the first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boyish student club and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">The Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the consultation events with candles.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff vigílie Schnidt also attended, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">The school started again on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is behind us.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Their feet for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been amended to reflect the fact that the police now claims that Lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb Prentiss called his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 polling numbers, which show that Donald Trump in real light</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to describe him as a man who often change their minds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others over the City as a bad joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some of them are preparing for the implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But whether some Republicans trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead to double figures, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the prospects of the real estate magnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still only the beginning of the electoral cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the Rick Perry made their way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them did not win a single position in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are many reasons why he could run in the general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeb Bush and economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's willingness to stand and begin to interpret their dollars on the table in order to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some of the recent numbers of votes, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's evaluation příznivosti has turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate magnate.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now has six out of 10 Republicans a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers are in the early stages of holding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Quinnipiac University after the vote, which took place last week, found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN / ORC poll, which was conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Donald Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 said that they were "outraged" of his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of people said they were "excited" against the 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if the frontrunner Jeb Bush became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans do not see Mr. Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide, is inclined to the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's vote, ABC News / Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is held in the senator's club in Iowa, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he has the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to this idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When he puts on his učenecké hats, Republican voters think Trump is a viable candidate.</seg>
<seg id="34">On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past, did not have the clearest crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of a candidacy against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nevertheless, it appears that a number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some scholars argue that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpovská support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But from the beginning of September, Monmouth University survey shows that in a hypothetical contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">Carly Fiorinou leads by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasichem, Chris Christie by 33 points in each.</seg>
<seg id="43">He is in a race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beat him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would lead the trader on the broad 19 points in a hypothetical game one against one.</seg>
<seg id="46">A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters argue that he has already made his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday showed that more than half of voters supporting Trump says that he will not change his mind.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is clear that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent of the states that they leave the way open for change among the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Mr. Trump is the strongest opponent of his outsider colleague, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who consider their minds in the final, if they were twice as likely to vote for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agrees with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Not since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration still holds as a principal and a central topic of conversation for the year 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some worry that Trump's bombast draw key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage to the efforts of a re-branding.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to a new poll on Monday, ABC / Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">It seems that as long as the topic of immigration will remain in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration of the government is reaching new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans in a new vote on Monday night, ABC / Post says they want a political outsider, rather than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also very angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."</seg>

<seg id="1">The State House supported a greater share of the fees for coal.</seg>
<seg id="2">Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">The House of Representatives in the first reading, supported the government's amendments to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from lignite opencast mining royalties from the mining company.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that it will receive the extra money as the Treasury and municipal budgets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The draft was criticized members of the opposition, who fear that the mining companies will no longer be willing to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they pay higher fees directly to the state government supported rozpočtu.Sněmovna at first reading amendments to the Mining Act, which among other things means that the state should receive a greater share of the revenue from the fees from lignite opencast mining from the mining company.</seg>
<seg id="6">Share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The draft also alters the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals, which the company earns.</seg>
<seg id="8">The change in the fees for the extraction of minerals has brought to the treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the municipal revenue is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the year before the municipalities received from fees of around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="11">From brown coal mining communities was about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="12">The amendment also provides for an increase in payments from the mining space with a production of 1000 crowns per hectare per year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The income from these payments should continue to fully belong to municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) Members said that thanks to the municipality will receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="15">The amount of mining fees will no longer determine the law, but it provides the government with its regulation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The remuneration is calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different types of minerals.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the government, is the reason for the change, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that the fee imposed by the government may not be in line with the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the minister, in this case, however, is not a tax because the state charged mineral, which is state property.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fees they receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money, and a quarter of the state.</seg>
<seg id="22">The same ratio will be even in the case of radioactive rocks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Part of the money that the state in fees from mining selects, will be ring-fenced.</seg>
<seg id="24">For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the Mine Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="25">The draft were criticised by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that will damage the municipalities affected by the extraction of the region.</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It is not possible to seek one of the poorest regions in order to improve the budget, the minister of finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prior to the increase in unemployment in the Reform Party MP warned Hana Aulická.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kucera wanted to return the government to work out.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the explanatory memorandum says that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees would not be reflected in the price of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="31">Major consumers such as power plants or power plants would not feel the price increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">"On the other hand, this increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," says the government.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to the rapporteur to novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial to MPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concepts and, most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mládkem Urban does not agree with the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.</seg>
<seg id="37">The limits on the CSA down, he says, should break for reasons of social, national, and due to the long term stability of domestic energy.</seg>

<seg id="11">However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr Corbyna, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's' Newsnight 'that labouristickému leaders recommended the national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in a top team of Mr Corbyna, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences at work also "harbored" following the appointment of Mr Corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit benefits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party to submit amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, Mr. Smith said, the shadow work and pensions secretary, that the party "very clearly" said government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has faced over the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">The leader of the Labour Party, which has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Islington North MP claims that PMQ are too confrontational and to refrain from the "swift response," so sprocket trade and, instead, promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when they attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also refrained from the idea that he would let the other colleagues to speakers from time to time for him, because he has said that the matter was discussed with the House spokesman John Bercowem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to depart from the style of the "Punch and Judy politics," which was often associated with PMQ, but several years later, he admitted that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their position among the other MP, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature of itself and far-reaching reforms are needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Metcash is launching a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers, and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build brand IGA using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IgA retailers and suppliers, adding brands such as Dunsborough, based on an ice cream maker Simmo's tastings at IGA stores and business owners are selling discounted tickets for Australian football league to local customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the seller of food, liquor and hardware will celebrate its annual investor's strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">The stakes are high, because the southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores are enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">In any event, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi, losing about 5 percent of the food market in these two countries during the 12 months since the opening of the first shops to take sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the west during the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss of food sales and volumes at a fixed price basis Metcash could cost him around $13 million in profits before tax, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, especially against Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by the year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, a leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne would be "highly likely to disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is known that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent from 2010, and earnings from food store Metcash, which adds about 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent from 2012, which reflects the operational development of speculation, because the sales and revenues are under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, wholesale counterattacked and invest more than $150 million a year to supplement the full price at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helping IGA retailers equip stores again by adding the rapidly growing food and novelties from individuals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash CEO, Ian Morrice, claims that the programs to top up the prices and retrofitting shops caught momentum and hopes to get back to the basic velkoprodej profitable growth in profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise for his behaviour, rather than criticism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has become collateral damage in the recent fuss over his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, says the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo, often called the "Special Ks," drew unwanted attention to themselves thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgiosem and Stan Wawrinkou at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon after, in a passionate qualification game in Cincinnati, had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the referee, Harrison then said: "Kyrgiosovi Wawrinka had one stretch and I had to pull him too."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen as he smashes a rocket after it derailed the cramp can overcome Richard Gasqueta at the US Open, Kokkinakise staunchly defended Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young man is currently in Glasgow, where they compete with Sam Grothem on location in the second singles spot behind Bernard Romicem in a Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was thinking about it quite strongly that, in my opinion, Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," says Healy.</seg>
<seg id="9">He destroyed his racket when he lost to a spasm in the US, but it is not the first player to be due to the frustration of itself took his anger out on his rocket. I know Thanasiho well enough, and I can say that this event will not be proud.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he was really very good, because he was in the US exposed to very provocative circumstances about Harrison and so on, so in my opinion, deserves great credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he also has a great family around me, and I think he treated somewhat hard.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a very mature 19 year-old man, he works very hard and it fits perfectly into the team, and so on, never had a problem with the other players in the dressing room is very respected, he trains hard, he's in great shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy, and I don't think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose for an important game, which starts on Friday, and states that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but it supports a native of Canberra to return to the team as a long term system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not at all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick was rising very quickly as Federer, Murray and others point out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he receives, but we're trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, when he will be able to think about it, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for himself.</seg>

<seg id="1">The European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closing the border and detaining migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the announcement of the state of emergency on Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and held by those who tried to its illegal crossing to stop the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants has piled up in the land and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those who are stuck for an unknown period of time on the strip of land between two countries are those who are fleeing violence in their native countries, building tents and takes up residence.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the feelings of frustration.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the helicopter passes over them, the migrants collectively called "Open the borders!" And cursing the Hungarian police riot squad.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of the protest refuse food and water.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Serbian foreign minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that the refugees were sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just an indirect injury.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over the next days will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a block of 28 countries to come up with a common immigration policy at the ongoing meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40 000 people seeking protection in the Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of achieving the eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, their hopes all this Junior ROTC stuff in Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions give authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up court cases dealing with asylum.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to move across the country, though it is now completed a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News work Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness, and the entry point into the European Union for the refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other countries in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a sight that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise breaches of 4 foot fence, which the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for a longer period in prison for those who illegally transferred the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of the Hungarian government declares state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very clear on this: The illegal crossing the border is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which is expected in the next week, but the Associated Press reporters on the edge of the heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban for domestic defense consultant, said that the authority had caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 have already caught on the territory of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">Through the damage to the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities quickly left to fix the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a skidder covered with barbed wire.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the main border crossing at Roszke created chaos, because the Hungarians have opened a small office in a metal container for processing and create the crush of people.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water, as long as they will not be allowed to cross the border into Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced by half in the national vote</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders joins her lead.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 per cent (an increase of 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the major competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision about which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">CBS News poll from last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained a few.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton retains a huge lead among women and reduces, but its lead is narrowing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men is significantly reduced, and Sanders loses to her only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated, and now they are equal with Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was in double digits ahead of Sanders among liberals, but now her Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters in the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would have supported it with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not encourage it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps it is no surprise that they are particularly contemporary přivrženci Clinton because of her passion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically supported it.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about the frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), followed by, it is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also cited the possibility of election and consensus on the issues.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would prefer to face - a third thinks that he would not run.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Democratic primary voters were asked who they would choose as a second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton's supporters said more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points, while Biden will run for 30 points without his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election; but this number dropped from 78 percent from last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a distant second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely zvolitelného, is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, when it came to the question of greater importance of candidate, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate does not act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democratic candidates or potential candidates, they have good results in some of the key characteristics among primary voters of his party.</seg>
<seg id="31">Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden from all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent it does not have this view.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.</seg>
<seg id="35">With regard to all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continues, the majority of Democratic primary voters are satisfied with the explanation of this issue and they say that their overall view of her did not affect at all.</seg>
<seg id="37">But among the American public, it is a different story.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third of it is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public's views on this topic were distributed in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say that the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, compared with 36 percent of their opinion of Clinton has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's all about the Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="42">Despite the fact that Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among voters on its side, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a decrease of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty two percent of registered voters don't think he is honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">And, at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But Clinton and Trump have good marks for the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested in the honesty of the best led Biden, Carson and Bush.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters don't have an opinion on him.</seg>
<seg id="48">Margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Almost two years after a student died during the přetěžovacího fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, was filed murder charges against five people.</seg>

<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity called 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to a hospital, police said.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is the tents when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Growth rates will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy slips into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know all of this.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the economy, in particular, offers a history of the originator of the timing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets to respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is the reason why the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors would not be focused on when it starts raising rates, but rather the trajectory, how long will it take to normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the game is actually more variables.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in the end, the members can make sure that all the fuss over an increase in speed can be exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of an era 'of cheap money,'" he said in a note to clients, Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low, creates a seismic shock that many might be scared.</seg>
<seg id="13">This means that there will be adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look at how they will react to certain areas of the economy, on the basis of historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">Given what the market has experienced in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little unstable.</seg>
<seg id="16">But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It seems that there is a trend for the cessation of shares for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the Fed's increase.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market for the past 35 years, most often - about 14 percent - is going to raise rates in the relatively flat in 250 days (the average growth rate of 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dolla, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate increases and the return is beginning to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recession is a fact of economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Fed is currently facing some of the conditions that still exist, and that could precipitate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in the history of the Fed's rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank was in the 118 raising rates only twice since 1950 nominal GDP growth below 4.5 percent year on year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Despite the fact that, in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few expect to sustain it when it was in the third quarter to just 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and could affect the question of "whether this time is different," said Deutsche.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants were ready to the Fed's growth for the whole year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC would be able to approve an increase in this session, the future trading indicates only a 25% probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, since 1950 were all zvyšovací cycles so far in the super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP for the beginning of the recession peaks very quickly after the onset of the recovery," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the other hand, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest of these, when the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and still continue.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income was also volatile, because the market is expecting a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to that experienced by the shares.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact is more pronounced in bonds than in stocks when the Fed will change the direction of policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, it seems that the revenue is changing direction immediately after the first cycle of increase / decrease.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of rising bond yields fall immediately, "Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in rates will cause approach yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which matches the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">A high yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still cautious about the tightening of the yield," said Kathy Jones, in his analysis, fixed income analyst firmly in the company of Schwab.</seg>
<seg id="37">The interesting thing is that Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads widened and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market, as the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the US, they win after an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with a lot of debt, will be worse because of the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will also be greater.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to outperform during the three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachsve analysts in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheets ahead of a weak balance sheet of any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also overcome their counterparts of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will become a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Beyond the purely stock games benefit consumers also thanks to the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will last.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for the "numbing"</seg>
<seg id="3">Takes the view that it is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals</seg>
<seg id="4">Also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that just cheat the Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not even an original idea</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3's "change" in the Classic FM, claims a leading MEP, piling fresh pressure on broadcasters to demonstrate that they are doing something that they don't do commercial broadcasts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public service radio station seems to be "ohlupována" and is increasingly nerozeznatelnější from its commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word" ohlupováno "- but it seems that is changing to Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be the British under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of, when in fact only imitate what we already have in the market, "said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Director General of the BBC denied the charges on the grounds that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would on any other radio.</seg>
<seg id="14">And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top level.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and new works in service is also very important," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of this year, argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey, it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the production of the BBC, who came under fire for treading on the toes of the commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sports, and they got to a committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Conservative MP Damian Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show, which the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Like for example Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can see why it is discussed on this programme as the knives and not particularly different?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith aBoy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants to "find the Corporation hit from its own stables" when it's time to start an entertaining series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, refused to rule out ordering more future seasons of the show, The Voice or spending money taxpayers royalties to other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="6">For more than a decade has been a virtual shopping on the rise, and thanks to him, many British high streets has become a ghost town.</seg>

<seg id="8">Total spending in August was the lowest increase in the growth of the measurement from the beginning of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.</seg>

<seg id="10">"If you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to the year 2000, the status quo is always rationalise over time," according to the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG index.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers started to use their mobile phones to carry out purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant that people were able to buy online, and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore appear to be bottoming out.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which had been adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe that customers could delay purchases before the event, which takes place the last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last year, five times more than the average shoppers turned to their computers to handle purchases and dropped several websites and retailers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, which shoppers bargain again, it can retain customers from other purchases</seg>
<seg id="18">The research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 in every £5 was spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, is more than a third of sales made via the web stores.</seg>

<seg id="57">On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in my life negrilovala.</seg>
<seg id="58">The vast majority of barbecuing and then several times a year.</seg>
<seg id="59">The barbecue to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adjust the meat marinate for several hours before the heat treatment.</seg>
<seg id="60">That oil is the most appropriate and at the same time, the barbecue leaves wholesome substances?</seg>
<seg id="61">In general, in the process of barbecue should conserve fat.</seg>
<seg id="62">Experts agree that a large part of the oil starts at high temperatures to lose its flavour.</seg>
<seg id="63">Healthy extra virgin oil, then comes the body of beneficial substances that otherwise we get from them in oil consumption of the dishes prepared at lower temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="64">But it does not mean that the extra virgin olive oil in the barbecue to find their application.</seg>
<seg id="65">Grape seed oil for the barbecue, health and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="66">When you think of meat, experts from the firm Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsku immediately think of grape seed oil.</seg>
<seg id="67">Beautifully complements the taste of meats and fish.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the kitchen is characterised by the unique properties of increasing the natural taste of food.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, to 216 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="70">Even at such a high temperature, then, as one of the few oils stored wholesome substances, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of the grapevine oil.</seg>
<seg id="71">Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin C.</seg>
<seg id="72">It also contains high levels of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in the fight with excess cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the grape oil also accepts our body important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.</seg>

<seg id="76">Chefs make use of grape oil in the kitchen of the pork.</seg>
<seg id="77">Not only is suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, such as seasoning salads, but also for the thermal treatment of dishes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The barbecue, therefore, can be used in two ways, by marinating and grilling itself.</seg>
<seg id="79">Marinate the meat and fish we will maintain their succulence.</seg>
<seg id="80">When preparing the marinade must be present three components: Oil, acidity and spice.</seg>
<seg id="81">For example, the acidity will deliver the apple vinegar and to enhance softening of meat.</seg>
<seg id="82">The spice gives the meat's taste and oil preserves and delivers the right sharpness, says Daniel Vlček.</seg>
<seg id="83">At the same time, it adds that grape seed oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils can penetrate through the dark meat.</seg>
<seg id="84">Marinated meat or fish are ready to barbecue, how to proceed?</seg>
<seg id="85">Extra virgin oils are characterised by the fact that there is enough to prepare meals just a few drops.</seg>
<seg id="86">The same is true for the barbecue.</seg>
<seg id="87">Some of the oils are for this method of absolute taboo.</seg>
<seg id="88">This applies especially to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be warm at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">Before the barbecue grate with oil to prevent food met Zack.</seg>
<seg id="90">An essential part of the barbecue is also preparing the annexes.</seg>
<seg id="91">The grilled meat and fish is virtually anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a green salad, and many others.</seg>
<seg id="92">The chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend Hot summer salad, for example.</seg>
<seg id="93">You need to: • 1 pcs peaches • 1 bunch arugula • 1 cup diced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of oil</seg>
<seg id="94">In a salad bowl, add to the mixture of their own arugula salad leaves, diced cucumbers and sliced peaches in large cubes.</seg>
<seg id="95">According to the taste of salt and opepřete, you can also flavor with minced chili and soy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="96">Finally, apply a few drops of oil.</seg>
<seg id="97">Salad for exceptional taste then you can sprinkle with finely sliced almonds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Multiple sclerosis: Not just the drugs, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.</seg>
<seg id="2">Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs care, a number of experts: A neurologist, a physiotherapist, ergoterapeuta, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation if they decide to have a child, to care for these patients include social advice, recommendations to regulate housing, etc.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet all of this is not enough: The development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.</seg>
<seg id="5">The more actively fight with the disease, the longer it can work and does not need to fundamentally change the style of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">As pointed out by doctors, the passivity of freeing up space for the activity of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, there is evidence that regular exercise significantly delays the time when ill needs a compensatory device, such as a cane.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is important that patients and their surroundings to various myths, for example, that the disease is automatically leads to end up in a wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="9">The site was created to give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign to give yourself a chance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most important person in the care of the patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.</seg>
<seg id="11">In multiple sclerosis is twice the adage that the disease is treated early, the more the physician can make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammation stage, when the process of neuro-degeneration is not so strong.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the invalidizaci, explains Dr. Eva Honey from Neurological Clinic General University Hospital in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitative care, which most often dealt with the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Working with the sick, according to their individual needs: To maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, alleviating swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is really an individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martin Kövári, chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation of the Clinic Teaching Hospital in Motol.</seg>
<seg id="17">People with multiple sclerosis does not suffer from the same disease, but each has a slightly different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The rehabilitation of the disease cannot be stopped, but always can alleviate her symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the exercise also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that you are sick, who can handle everything, and it strengthens their confidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The exercise is also washed up endorphins and make you feel good," says PhD Camilla kelp from the Clinic Rehabilitation Medicine Teaching Hospital Královské Vinohrady.</seg>
<seg id="22">By changing the physical side, we operate on the limbic system, responsible for emotions.</seg>
<seg id="23">So we intervene directly into the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Previously, these patients supposedly saved, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. mezzosoprano Pavel Kolar, director of the Clinic for rehabilitation and physical medicine Teaching Hospital in Motol.</seg>
<seg id="25">The physical therapy is to remain independent for as long as possible, including work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Physiotherapists are working with ergoterapeuty, therefore, that each person was given a compensatory tool suited to him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many patients also needs the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="28">They are in a difficult situation.</seg>
<seg id="29">When it comes to the life of a serious illness, the majority of people will shake it.</seg>
<seg id="30">Experience the shock, panic, fear.</seg>
<seg id="31">Must respond to a major burden - the loss of health.</seg>
<seg id="32">With such agonized soul, we have to go after someone, trying to take it all on his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I work with them so that he finally came to the conclusion that, even with a disability can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Raspberry - Schubert of Neurological Clinic General University Hospital in Prague.</seg>

<seg id="11">The accuracy is the main motto.</seg>
<seg id="12">Be cranking the keys leaves the company to adjust twice a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the yellow sticker lacked a record of control, they should be in the race to explain what auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who travels regularly to check if the doors are produced according to agreed rules.</seg>
<seg id="14">The human senses but advanced technology not yet completely replaced.</seg>
<seg id="15">On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.</seg>
<seg id="16">You must manually nýtaři shakes.</seg>
<seg id="17">It takes them two days.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even by the sound of hammers will know if it is a rivet properly shaken.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tolerance, in which they move, is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rivet can appear above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.</seg>
<seg id="22">When it comes to control a number of trained touch.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the controller runs a finger along a row of rivets, can tell if one is out of tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only then picks up the exact úchylkoměr.</seg>
<seg id="25">Flights fed before 1989 the military aircraft program L-39.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in 1991, he made not one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company had to quickly find a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then, put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="29">She won the tender for an emergency door for the A321 model.</seg>
<seg id="30">Courtship with Boeing were not so happy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We were at that time for them, a small firm that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee a long term stable supply," recalls Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="32">The door to the American manufacturers would remain closed if Letov in 1999, delivered at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry associations, the French group Latecoere.</seg>
<seg id="33">I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second day started negotiations with the French, says Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="35">A year later she bought Latecoere Czech company, and with a strong company came new contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the year 2000, started assembling parts of the doors for the A320.</seg>
<seg id="37">Three years later, the doors were added the upper decks for the A380.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2006, the company has built a new hall for the processing of composites for supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.</seg>
<seg id="39">Without Latecoere, we didn't get ourselves to these large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="40">Maybe we do parts or small parts.</seg>
<seg id="41">The partners want to guarantee supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="42">Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Exclusive position between the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.</seg>
<seg id="44">Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="45">The company must have a quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification cards for key employees.</seg>
<seg id="46">Without them, the company did not produce any doors to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="47">To obtain the certificates that manufacturing processes are consistent with the requirements of customers, and keeping them in multiple checks, according to Dubský is worth millions of crowns.</seg>
<seg id="48">The manufacturing processes are changing every year.</seg>
<seg id="49">They are more accurate and more stringent.</seg>
<seg id="50">We have doškolovat employees, be retrofitted to devices and certify the whole process again, Dubský adds.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now the company is finalising the preparation process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing cadmium harmful to human health.</seg>
<seg id="52">The award was received from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology for the device or chemicals that are used in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="53">People come from Boeing, will examine the concept of the entire line.</seg>
<seg id="54">Then we give them the production.</seg>
<seg id="55">Check out our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="56">One set of samples to test out alone in his lab, and then compare the results with our, approaching Dubský way is controlled by customers.</seg>
<seg id="57">Reward is the Prague company long term exclusive contracts.</seg>
<seg id="58">Today, with the Prague race stands or falls embraerů production.</seg>
<seg id="59">For the A320 produces half of the total volume of the door.</seg>
<seg id="60">Replace the Czech Latecoere is for Brazilian or European manufacturer is either impossible or very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="61">This does not mean, however, that the door could say any price.</seg>
<seg id="62">Part of the contract is the price curve.</seg>
<seg id="63">This indicates how many doors will be after ten, fifty, a hundred pieces produced.</seg>
<seg id="64">The price for a piece of still dropping to a certain limit value.</seg>
<seg id="65">In this price formula, we need to go.</seg>
<seg id="66">If not, we will lose business, says Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="67">Half of the hall, where they assemble electrical cabinets for military Airbus A400 M, is still empty.</seg>
<seg id="68">However, it is a symbol of the future.</seg>
<seg id="69">Behind the screen, it is building a new line of riveting polorobotická and fitting doors for the upgraded model of the A320 Neo.</seg>
<seg id="70">Riveting accelerates and more precise.</seg>
<seg id="71">"This is a trend that is mounting in aviation is going," adds Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="72">Sales has a future line secured.</seg>
<seg id="73">Airbus reports that the airlines have not yet ordered 3278 pieces of the new model of the A320.</seg>
<seg id="74">Only a few metres beside a line for a complete assembly of the door to the upper deck of the A380.</seg>
<seg id="75">It is a strategic decision of our parent company.</seg>
<seg id="76">The aim is to shorten the time of production and reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="77">The full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="78">Before that, however, the company must go through the qualification tests required for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="79">The company is betting on further development of the production of composite materials.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition to the Boeing should also be involved in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the American Dreamlineru.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It is a huge credit to the company, if they can process in addition to metal materials and composites," he says proudly Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="82">Latecoere, however, in the Czech Republic is on the edge of the production capacity.</seg>
<seg id="83">Letov in the area where they are located, it is not another place.</seg>
<seg id="84">Before the entry into force of the French mothers had a company of 180 employees.</seg>
<seg id="85">Now there are 800 and within three years, there could be a hundred more.</seg>
<seg id="86">As long as they Airbus and Boeing compete to see how many hundreds of new aircraft, the airline industry every year, may not be worried about the work.</seg>
<seg id="87">Although the contract for several years in advance, the parent company of the Prague Latecoere was faced with the threat of bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="88">The French group did not have enough money to loan repayments in September.</seg>
<seg id="89">Finally, Latecoere was able to communicate with the main creditors.</seg>
<seg id="90">At the end of August, a portion of the loans in exchange for shares.</seg>
<seg id="91">Creditors in the company the capital increase of 57.4 million euros share of 37.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="92">The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, about 180 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="93">The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="94">The company has subscribed to the existing shareholders new shares at 222,9 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="95">So in total capital raised about 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="96">The whole group is benefiting from the growing production of the Airbus and Boeing, who account for 85 percent of sales.</seg>
<seg id="97">The average growth is expected to contract by four percent a year until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="98">In the custom book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four years of production.</seg>
<seg id="99">The French media claims that Latecoere, finally, after years in the VA can breathe again.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Czech race in its wake is significant for the group.</seg>
<seg id="101">Contributes to the sales of the group of 16 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">MPs support a greater share of the state charges for coal.</seg>
<seg id="2">The change in the fees for the extraction of minerals has brought to the treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the municipal revenue is to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the year before the municipalities received from fees of around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="5">From brown coal mining communities was about 200 million crowns and the state of 66 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="6">The amendment also provides for an increase in reimbursement from the mining space with the extraction of a thousand crowns per hectare per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The income from these payments should continue to fully belong to municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) Members said that thanks to the municipality will receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="9">The amount of mining fees will no longer determine the law, but it provides the government with its regulation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The remuneration is calculated by multiplying the number of newly harvested the mineral and rates for different types of minerals.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the government, is the reason for the change, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Member of the ODS Marek Benda but warned that the fee imposed by the government may not be in line with the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the minister, in this case, however, is not a tax because the state charged mineral, which is state property.</seg>
<seg id="14">The fees they receive only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the case of deep coal mining will get three quarters of the money, and a quarter of the state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The same ratio will be even in the case of radioactive rocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Part of the money that the state in fees from mining selects, will be ring-fenced.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the mining or to ensure the Mine Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="19">The draft today criticised the opposition MPs who claimed in particular that will harm the municipalities affected by the extraction of the region.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is not possible to seek one of the poorest regions in order to improve the budget, the minister of finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prior to the increase in unemployment in the Reform Party MP warned Hana Aulická.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to reject, Kucera wanted to return the government to work out.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the explanatory memorandum says that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees would not be reflected in the price of coal, because the prices are more than 90 percent of the contracted over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="25">Major consumers such as power plants or power plants would not feel the price increase.</seg>
<seg id="26">"On the other hand, this increases the risk that the mining organisations will increase payments to compensate for efforts to reduce its operating expenses, which would essentially mean a reduction in the number of employees," says the government.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is, however, an increase in fees from the point of view of employment viable.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the rapporteur to novel Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial to MPs before the approval of the law knew the conclusions on the updated energy concepts and, most importantly, the government's decision to cap coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="29">If the coal will also benefit the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mládkem Urban does not agree with the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fall until after 2020.</seg>
<seg id="31">The limits on the CSA down, he says, should break for reasons of social, national, and due to the long term stability of domestic energy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who think that the Federal Reserve will make a decision now think that they will remain dormant for some time, and will retain the interest rate in the range of 0 to 0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event, because he sat years have passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time, we get to a situation where the central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and begin the process of normalisation of interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, the Head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?</seg>
<seg id="2">Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long before she learns almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it may not be David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">To query the service providers of children's schedules to appoint the popular children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, fable from Dr Seuss in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the website of the company SuperCamps and continues: "Funny, poignant, creative and with a strong content, so I like to read to their children, because it was always an image or a message that I've never seen before."</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, except that in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the book, according to the elevator from the 2012 film, which added more characters and details to fill the brief original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Thneed-Ville in the city surrounded by walls, where all of the Nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling its desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that alone wasn't enough suspicious text supplied by Cameron summary reads like a movie, the Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city, walled Thneed-Ville, where all of the Nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."</seg>
<seg id="9">Because he was openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron met with the plot books, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature devastates greedy, trees kácející industrialista Once-reading that despite the protests of the cover the Lorax, crouched, kníratého creature who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely that relatively few major PR task was an assistant who had never read the Lorax child 20 times in a row.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was in danger of omission of England, but still holds</seg>
<seg id="2">To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has selected for this tour, it will be to repeat the 3-0 defeat suffered last time in a Test series, not very likely.</seg>
<seg id="3">I also would not rule out winnings directly to guests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and also the collective mindset is strong; you do not bear the scars of 2012, only the youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ball is emerging spinner Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England team in the experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to omit Adam Lytha is hard for me to analyse, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven tests cost against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that the cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, around the names of Joe Root, there were no question marks, which led to the announcement, because - and I've said this before - the players are his best atribute.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of other half century and Lyth could extend his series, but he was in control of their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let's hope that if he could get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely accurate, and it doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much of the time the batsman gets to show himself, it is a tough nut to crack.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven caps - as well as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton has won nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton had a chance at home and outside.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only thing that you could gripe is that England gave the first chance in the Caribbean Jonathan Lyth Trottovi - even though he was in the best shape - but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales is coming, and it is the batsman, whom I consider very positively.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's x-factor cricketer, whom we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when we get to 236 on the pitch at Trent Bridge, which was a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors were, but all of this will of course depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea that Moeen begins alongside Cook, who would receive the extra spinner while retaining the four quicks were raised, and I have no reservations against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't understand why he can't bat strokemaker and the shorter man has already shown that he is a wonderful cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there is a big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his appearance in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">Immediately, he made three centuries and never looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, struck me as a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at the gross statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see it as a rowboat, but not a lot of spinnerů who raised their hands, and selektoři opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">There's a lot to learn on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Outside the team, it seems that England has made a few changes and their smart additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, batsmen from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience that they have experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes as part of a tour of white-ball and bring to the team as energy, so the ruthless spark.</seg>
<seg id="32">I've always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just as Mahela has the intellect, which can be used.</seg>
<seg id="33">New voices in the locker room, even though they are consistent voices saying things that have been said before, they can sometimes lighten and freshen up the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collyho Durham teammate Ben Stokes got the day off, as well as Root received a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although many disagree on it, the coaches and selektoři do not create a timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, as the players that depends on the results of their work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions can never be taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="4">A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in a variety of crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the contracts that they wouldn't usually.</seg>
<seg id="5">At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC has decided that they want it even if eroding social protection.</seg>

<seg id="9">My European friend who wants to nezahleděnou Britain in Europe - "don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some of the major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, the German chancellor carefully balanced, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years, and he wants to leave his post before it will be bad for her, as was the case for too long continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>

<seg id="14">It is difficult to see how to break the legs to help the selfie Britons who could better invest its energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is what they want for themselves, because they have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful remarks style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in 2017 in Great Britain in order to speed up the process of Brexit, says a friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation solve the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value out of the negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans to their own detriment, they know how ferocious Fleet Street can be and how the oligarchs are skeptical of the EU press barons, because they were inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the elusive Euro-opportunist, who made his name as the EU's Brussels correspondent "straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included a mixture of villains defaulting tax, foreigners hackujících phones and pseudo nezámořské departments, which owned most of the major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he realized that when you are in a cage with wild gorilla, you have to throw her bananas to give you to dinner, and then also to tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he said Cameron's referendové routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned his card dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press never forgave him, too.</seg>
<seg id="24">But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday at Westminster in a friendly pat on the back - I told him that I must not waste time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting the strategy of boycotting Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of media engagement, not with me, but I'm sure with Andrew - Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbin's official position on Europe, I'll say it nicely, evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Says he would like to stay in a reformed European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside the violent tendencies of UKIP and the wild shores of Tory's small Englanderismu can certainly agree on that.</seg>
<seg id="29">The same thing, "said Hilary Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't bring himself to admit that the appointment Corbynovo abrazivního McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Match Hillary was much more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Bennina phrase - presumably not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said colleagues and members of their private meeting on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the background of any kind, sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - a discipline report remains important in the ages of the day's television transmission and particularly in faith, swinging hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media</seg>
<seg id="34">Cameron is fair not to provide a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider supporting the Labor Party in referendové campaign for granted, as noted by McDonnell.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnellovo and Corbynovo basic equivocation about EU membership - in line with the Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist history - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussions between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences of the central nature of the doctrinal squabbles.</seg>
<seg id="37">Just as with his equivocation on Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that it will not want to terminate the campaign JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their own masters.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - are also suspicious voters - because of the concessions of Britain, though it seems pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States is already quite disappointed from a "weak performance by the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and also in reducing the cost of conservative governments in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of what was called the Security Forum of the British influence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise the review of electronic published by Public Health England</seg>
<seg id="2">Statement by a government funded agency that electronic cigarettes are about 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers claim.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of evidence used in his report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (however).</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the agency published a "mezníkovou" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, several researchers questioned the robustness of the data and drew attention to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the journal The Lancet last month attacked the "extremely weak base" on which the agency based its main conclusions, however.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other experts who write for the BMJ, disputed the claim, which was supposedly "built on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They indicate that the public might expect the agency's claims, however, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this conclusion comes from one of the 12 people meeting convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell states that a sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly has previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">BAT also approved the mandate of public health in the report on sustainability, states.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding, which allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but they contain a number of known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim in the paper industry funding.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, also took part in the meeting in the tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report created in this group "eloquently admits" missing "hard evidence about the dangers of most products on most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or restriction is not described in the report, however.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that claim, however, that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing, however, said that the allegations in the BMJ has already been answered before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Phe has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what do not appear, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative risk compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would give their right arm "" behind hit shows such as Albert Square.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not recognised by another British television.</seg>
<seg id="4">The BBC was criticised for being put on public service programmes, which is likely to follow only a handful of people in complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "highest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the director general Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to contact with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I struggle with the idea that the BBC awards and broadcast programs that would surely have been broadcast rivals without the contributions of the state," Johnson said in the committee for communication in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you keep your license fees, which I am not sure whether they are in the medium or long term, a good idea, it should reduce the creation of at least as far as the programs that produced different or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Broadcast The Voice in prime time, because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would have aired it, is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, absurd.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed by bezpříspěvkově.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one of them, EastEnders, and, of course, produced on home soil.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would have given them calmly in his right hand.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't understand how they are public broadcasting service.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think it would not in the least weaken the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a businessman in the series, which led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that they feel guilty by overhauling ratings "due to the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed that it is the best way to ensure long term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His commentary on the most popular show on the BBC repeats that the former CEO of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC will sell a show like EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that even the BBC hýčkanější public service programmes "passes on BBC4, where the audience can be measured quite often, but its power and they can argue when they embark on their hypocritical mission justify £4BN income from royalties," but of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is watching. "</seg>
<seg id="18">Is broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="19">With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find regresivnější system about who will get the best value out of it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, we all think of 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for the people, for which there is a lot of 150 pounds, I would be surprised if they paid so much, because it is not so much on the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its reithovskou mission in the sense of "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He confirmed that a small amount of production, the BBC has now been previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, enlighten and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the subject of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which was aired on television only a handful, and to connect with the commercial reporters, so we could see them all online.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Sonogenetika" or control of brain cells using sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The scientists raised worms with genetically modified neural system that can control the sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tiny nematode changes direction at a time when they are affected by the acoustic pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses are working so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetika that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells and activates the outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California said to The Guardian that this method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure, in which they are added to the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain, for example, the method is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematodes usually do not respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction will be when it is placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">How he found bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then passes through the body of worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some cells of the worms.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thanks to the acoustic waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are associated, reported in the journal Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to be able to control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.</seg>
<seg id="14">When she used to such modified worms ultrasound, sound waves were amplified by mikrobublinami and transferred to the worms, which actuates the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The new method is much like optogenetice, groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chalasani, however, has said that sonogenetika could have many advantages compared to this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike the lights, which must be sent to the optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissues without restrictions and be sent directly to the brain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">He added that his application would also found the method for the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1">The eight golden rules for life in the student house</seg>
<seg id="2">11 years ago, I moved to the college as a disinterested boy of nineteen, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but until now I recall tense smiles of those whom I resented - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everything I learned it can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving on the tracks can range from a slightly irritating running after totally appalling.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is tempting to babble: To tell people where you're from, if you take a year off, how do you feel about Corbyna and why "I honestly love not just hate Marmite, because people, it's just yeast extract hahaha, I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a deep breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help the others to breathe too - ask and expression of interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It drives the conversation and help you to find the people you love, and you, that you didn't have fun even if your eyelashes were on fire and they could pose a fire extinguisher.</seg>
<seg id="9">Let the people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">The rooms of people often turn to drinking receptions, the film evenings and municipal public places, but they are also a room in which people dress up and adjusting their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't even think about that you started to go to college and be in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">High introverts are very short.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a sanctuary, but a lot of the tracks changes to mimopokojovou walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to a lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">It can be a nightmare for someone who needs to recharge.</seg>
<seg id="15">No culture does not allow you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy that I used to talk to you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: Tap.</seg>
<seg id="18">One boy in my tracks was in the habit of that, if the doors are not locked, is invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw a couple of things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Your friends thanks to the baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because you started going to university at the top of the baking craze, knocking on doors and performances with plate upečenými cakes seems slightly less strange, less than the "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering local delicacies is a good way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your roommate will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it will end up so that your face will be assigned to the succulent surprises.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is, of course, the fact that you are a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and the carbon probably jams that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food on college campuses is a common crime.</seg>
<seg id="27">The theft of the chicken, of course, is a crime, but it is a drop of milk in your tea theft?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check it twice with the owner of the milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a chance that they will offer you milk even when they are inside the rampage.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals something, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more mature than my roommate, who traded his milk for the dishwashing liquid to punish the thief.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he is in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You should not make noises that distracts people from sleep or study.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are also known for people in glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl from my hallway has asked its neighbours if they could turn it down a little drum and bass, because there were three in the night and had a test in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">Their answer was the amplification of music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When he finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, let them sleep for two hours and then set up his own music, locked the door and went to his three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">It would be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you do?</seg>
<seg id="38">And, on the other hand, it would be terribly embarrassing if you have the wrong roommate for his future wife, slept together, broke up and they had to see each other every day, and perhaps it would also take control of your mutual friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, you can't help - but if your sexy roommate definitely is not your future spouse, try to get at least a little talk with their weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the sublime moment when you realize that someone had left the keys in an unlocked room, there is a fine line between fun and bullying.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good joke is funny, but easy to fix.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach them valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by giving them something to hide - never do not destroy someone's room toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which is then put in the freezer - but they never leave their things on the ceiling more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="4">The last two will also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.</seg>
<seg id="5">The current trend of Apple is that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="6">The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight has increased slightly compared to the previous iPhonům.</seg>
<seg id="7">2 g weight difference to the detriment of the news was really negligible.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, this is not the case for the new iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="9">IPhonům compared to last year's 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model has risen by 14 grams, with more then 20 grams.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the one hand, it is no surprise, last year's affair bending in the pockets of Apple greatly worried.</seg>

<seg id="17">The display on the iPhone 6s is the hardest component.</seg>

<seg id="19">The larger model is the most difficult element of the batteries, its weight, however, compared to predecessor has not changed in any way.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flakes are the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists made the discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="3">They discovered that traces of modern humans from different eras, including murals, remnants of the instruments, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the 23A, which, according to the tools dated to around 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered but something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, on the spot, they found traces of oat grains, which on the surface appears to have passed through the process of production so popular flakes today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today, the grains soak first, then dry, get rid of the packaging, scouring, then steamed and do flat.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cave in Paglicci managed to discover the grains, which was apparently nahřáta or spařena, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the telltale traces of the use of two stones in a cave.</seg>
<seg id="8">The scientists therefore failed in its publication in the journal PNAS demonstrate that in the cave was a complete cereal production process, but the similarity is indeed very striking.</seg>
<seg id="9">We also have no evidence about how people could eat cereal, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly warm, of course, is entirely logical.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely people use cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="11">If there is a snowflake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture roughly twenty thousand years.</seg>

<seg id="1">The new report Transport House stations in the city of Brno.</seg>
<seg id="2">So once again, I listened to the reports of the names of stops in a trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat noisier, so reports a man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the station reported a woman's voice.</seg>
<seg id="4">A woman's voice is higher, so in a deeper traffic noise is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although DPMB argues that this announcer chose the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but it certainly picked up from the studio recordings made in total silence, which, of course, so were quite different than the noise of the bus engine.</seg>
<seg id="6">I live in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the names of all those zastávkek by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere, who are not in Brno, and for which these reports are primarily intended, they may be confused and may be in the final, where they arrived by mistake, then claim that the station that they had to speak, was not reported at all.</seg>
<seg id="7">Perhaps he should announce the selection - but better anchor again - to do it again, and this time, tinged with normal traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the bleating of the speaker is almost lost in the bus.</seg>
<seg id="8">We didn't have to listen to the names of stations Water Heršpice, Šmírova or then Submersible vehicles in the creaking šalině, to which I am in Komárově transferred.</seg>

<seg id="1">Good morning, sir.</seg>
<seg id="2">From the traťováka.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, many people don't know what kind of government by the biggest and brightest were called comprehensive background checks.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took the liberty to reminisce.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bus was late.</seg>
<seg id="6">I bumped into the dispatcher's office at the time when he heard on the radio, that is just seven hours.</seg>
<seg id="7">"You're lucky you hit with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems that's not in the mood," the dispatcher said, while I was writing in a log.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks, I'll watch out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tell me that I'm going to districts to revise the minor mechanization.</seg>
<seg id="10">It doesn't work, there are checks today.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are all scared of it, the horror.</seg>
<seg id="12">What is going on?</seg>
<seg id="13">"You'll see," said the dispatcher.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next time you will be, too.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ran out into the hall.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then the door opened and appeared náčelnikárny chief.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stiff, with a straight face, in an impeccably tailored uniform.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Good morning, Chief," I said reverently and quickly zipped the two buttons jacket uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, and I realized the cold, ominous tone that old replied.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You're messing with," she greeted me an engineer Eva, an elderly lady, which I appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was also the chief even before her comrades were deposed.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are checks and you get barely.</seg>
<seg id="23">How many times have I asked what are the comprehensive background checks, but no one really wants to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">They tend to be once every three years, they have all of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="25">At least for some.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apparently, however, I see.</seg>
<seg id="27">I pulled out of the drawer file with periodic reports and then the phone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This Holcman, come to me now," said the chief's voice.</seg>
<seg id="29">What poisons?</seg>
<seg id="30">Now we met and nothing... "I murmured, but no one answered, each with just your thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Good morning, sir, I came to your command," I omeldoval, when I entered the náčelnikárny.</seg>
<seg id="32">The chief was sitting behind his desk and looked at a clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Comrade mechanizátore," he said, without looking up, still studying that paper, "I don't like your behavior."</seg>
<seg id="34">He threw the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair and stared at me like usual, unpleasant, evil, beady eyes.</seg>
<seg id="35">I hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="36">What's going on?</seg>
<seg id="37">Just yesterday, the deputy said that over the last few months in office, I worked very well and he is very happy with me.</seg>
<seg id="38">That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at the break.</seg>
<seg id="39">And now this?</seg>
<seg id="40">You realize that you're the technician track distance and according to this, you have to act.</seg>
<seg id="41">A greeting, what did you use this morning, is simply unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="42">I stammered that I use a greeting from my childhood that I was brought up that way and I don't see anything wrong with it.</seg>
<seg id="43">The chief, it was like a red rag to the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You are a socialist rail and the only acceptable greeting is an honor," said beleaguered chief.</seg>
<seg id="45">And besides, you still reaching out to his superiors.</seg>
<seg id="46">Once you say "sir" and "comrade" again for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="47">But I am not a chief for you, but the chief comrade.</seg>
<seg id="48">Deputies are comrades deputies, Principal Chief traťmistři traťmistři are comrades!</seg>
<seg id="49">It in your mind!</seg>
<seg id="50">Excuse me, sir, sir, but... but I greet you a normal civil greeting.</seg>
<seg id="51">There's nothing wrong... and the honour of a job, or a comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...</seg>
<seg id="52">"This is not your preference, you're not in the side," the chief said coldly, who had calmed down a little.</seg>
<seg id="53">Still, however, will be talking about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">Anyway, remember that the chair at the top you have a prepaid retirement.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was not good.</seg>
<seg id="56">When the chief told somebody that something is not his priority, it didn't look good with that.</seg>
<seg id="57">He glared at me for a while with a cold, piercing eyes and I was looking for the words to respond.</seg>
<seg id="58">I am also annoyed that his haughty friendship.</seg>
<seg id="59">It was only a few years older and playing God, actually soudruhaboha.</seg>
<seg id="60">Jovial, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, as he could use at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="61">Him all vykali.</seg>
<seg id="62">Well, it is the chief.</seg>
<seg id="63">Actually, not all of them, the chairman of partisan organizations like all straníkům him, but also nestraníkům, formally.</seg>
<seg id="64">But the chief addressed many, especially those who are able to exercise their superiority.</seg>
<seg id="65">Wiped me right now for a complete bullshit.</seg>
<seg id="66">I thought about my ass, and it cost me quite an effort to shoot him in the face.</seg>
<seg id="67">But I didn't return to the road to the pickaxes, let alone to keep track of doing.</seg>
<seg id="68">What would I feed my two kids?</seg>
<seg id="69">And the pristine house!</seg>
<seg id="70">It made me want to cry, but I controlled myself.</seg>
<seg id="71">I won't give him the satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="72">"That's all for now, you can go," said the chief audience and began exploring the paper, which had been in his hands.</seg>
<seg id="73">At 11: 30, call me.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everyone in the office were already there, and the question of what, and how, they said, yeah, that would be good.</seg>
<seg id="75">Only Pecos Bill said tartly, as was his wont, he can't get rid of all of us, because they would have to do the job comrade chief alone with his faithful, and that she was safe.</seg>
<seg id="76">The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what the old me in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="77">The náčelnikárně was a nice reunion.</seg>
<seg id="78">Comrade chief behind his desk and at a long conference table other comrades who had to decide on my way of existence or nonexistence.</seg>
<seg id="79">Personnel manager, chairman of the ROH, a reporter from personnel officer for specific purposes, like a kontráše in the army, and the deputy, my boss.</seg>
<seg id="80">And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.</seg>
<seg id="81">I knew him from the road.</seg>
<seg id="82">A track worker, podbíjel sleepers or pitchforks thrown gravel.</seg>
<seg id="83">But also a former prison guard.</seg>
<seg id="84">There wasn't any fun with him at the time, said that big beast.</seg>
<seg id="85">Tongues have claimed that the school came in the seventh grade, was not nothing, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="86">And when the prison was canceled, ended up on the road with a pickax.</seg>
<seg id="87">But, comrade, comrade was forged.</seg>
<seg id="88">Chief motioned for me to sit down.</seg>
<seg id="89">My heart sank, my throat nespolknutelná cone.</seg>
<seg id="90">Someone read the opinion of the civic committee from a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="91">I come from a working class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="92">So far, so good, I thought, and I breathe a little better.</seg>
<seg id="93">Then the opinion of the street party.</seg>
<seg id="94">This reflects the opinion of the civic committee, perhaps the same man wrote both of them.</seg>
<seg id="95">But then it came!</seg>
<seg id="96">Parents are longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the committee and subsequently by prověrkovou speakers, ostensibly for health reasons.</seg>
<seg id="97">The chief looked sharply at me.</seg>
<seg id="98">Someone noticed it and stopped reading.</seg>
<seg id="99">Chief motioned that he has to continue.</seg>
<seg id="100">It was just getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="101">I was a member of the Municipal Committee of the SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="102">Regardless of the parents who spoke from the side, the party gave me confidence.</seg>
<seg id="103">But I got married and the wedding in addition to the national committee am I was also at the church.</seg>
<seg id="104">By the confidence I failed in the worst way.</seg>
<seg id="105">That's why I was removed from the ranks of its candidates.</seg>
<seg id="106">But it wasn't enough!</seg>
<seg id="107">I had two children baptized, and even my mother when she died, I went to the funeral, even though it was a former member of the Party.</seg>
<seg id="108">I say all this negative attitude to the role of the party.</seg>
<seg id="109">If someone read only tapping his pencil on the desk was a tense silence.</seg>
<seg id="110">Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, I am constantly repeated in the spirit of "commies lob - supermen, communists - supermen." What have I got myself into?</seg>
<seg id="112">Why I prefer to stay at the smiths?</seg>
<seg id="113">Repair switches I could even without some crappy clearances.</seg>
<seg id="114">But now?</seg>
<seg id="115">Track officials took his career before it had begun.</seg>
<seg id="116">Go back to the squad?</seg>
<seg id="117">That may not be possible, the chief definitely me for an hour.</seg>
<seg id="118">"Comrade, how did you check the comrade here?" The chief issue breaking the silence on a cadre.</seg>
<seg id="119">Well, according to a report from the previous employment.</seg>
<seg id="120">You have it here?</seg>
<seg id="121">Kádrovákovi apparently not twice.</seg>
<seg id="122">The beads of sweat on the forehead, blinking nervously, as if he were reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="123">The chief nodded eagerly and handed a piece of paper.</seg>
<seg id="124">"Well," the chief said with a hint of conviviality, which is often used to be a harbinger of storms.</seg>
<seg id="125">At first glance, nothing but praise, trained with honors, he graduated from Polytechnic, he worked as a locksmith aggregated, standard performed by an average of one hundred and twenty percent.</seg>
<seg id="126">But it is essential.</seg>
<seg id="127">Where did you get that reference, comrade? "He turned again to a cadre, who felt that it kind of begins to turn against him, and that it would not be very soon, perhaps even kádrovákem.</seg>
<seg id="128">This comrade gave it to me, at the onset.</seg>
<seg id="129">Was enough for you?</seg>
<seg id="130">"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to the squad," a personnel manager.</seg>
<seg id="131">And there are reports do not require his was, somehow, so I gave it to him in the folder.</seg>
<seg id="132">"So, for inclusion in the technical functions of this piece of paper," the chief said dryly.</seg>
<seg id="133">Someone blinked nervously and did not have to answer.</seg>
<seg id="134">"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," said the chief and kádrovákovi seemed relieved.</seg>
<seg id="135">For the time being, take it.</seg>
<seg id="136">"So what about you, comrade?" The chief turned to me again.</seg>
<seg id="137">A first-name basis with me, so that's the end!</seg>
<seg id="138">In the eyes of my vision, my scalding hot.</seg>
<seg id="139">Followed by a torrent of accusations and allegations, and I knew that I was the ugliest creature in the world that does not deserve any mercy.</seg>
<seg id="140">I was planting an incomplete report misled Comrade cadre Examiner, which I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from a cadre at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="141">I also antisocialistický element, which at the time of the building of socialism promotes the flow of religious obscurantism, or even participate in them.</seg>
<seg id="142">That it was a lot of things I've done, or perhaps even commit and I quietly prayed for it to end.</seg>
<seg id="143">I didn't care.</seg>
<seg id="144">I didn't care if I fly from the mechanizátora.</seg>
<seg id="145">I didn't care that they take me and the pickaxe.</seg>
<seg id="146">This is a job for the honest and decent people, not for an enemy of the people that I was in the eyes of the chief.</seg>
<seg id="147">"That's it, sir," said the party chairman and emphatically interrupted the chief's levity.</seg>
<seg id="148">This comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.</seg>
<seg id="149">What a mistake, just stupid!</seg>
<seg id="150">But he's already got his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="151">Don't forget that, sir!</seg>
<seg id="152">What could be worse for a young person than he was at the time we close the door to the side.</seg>
<seg id="153">He opened again, he will have to prove that he's changed that, once again, is worthy of our trust.</seg>
<seg id="154">Uneducated guard spoke like a book.</seg>
<seg id="155">Where did that come from?</seg>
<seg id="156">It is so literate or parroting phrases from partisan training and meetings?</seg>
<seg id="157">That is also why this young comrade must be given a chance from us!</seg>
<seg id="158">A chance to prove that he has changed.</seg>
<seg id="159">And who is to give it to him, if not just you, sir?</seg>
<seg id="160">It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, support in its efforts to remedy.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is your party obligation that no one will free you!</seg>
<seg id="162">In fact, it is also party to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="163">This comrade must see that the party did not forget about him.</seg>
<seg id="164">That punishes not only as a good mother, but she also loves.</seg>
<seg id="165">When the President ended, no one said a word.</seg>
<seg id="166">No one expected such a reversal of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="167">At least I.</seg>
<seg id="168">"I totally agree with you, Mr. President," the chief said icily in an attempt to regain the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="169">If you let me finish, you would have heard that I was going to such a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="170">All nodded, but it was up to them to see that he does not believe a word of it.</seg>
<seg id="171">"So I was confirmed for the independent examiner care for basic resources," I yelled when returning to the office and then I began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="172">That's in addition to Eva's engineers were all at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="173">She listened in silence my incoherent narrative of fresh experiences and I calmed down in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="174">When I was finished, she asked whether I'll have a cup of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="175">Without waiting for an answer, put the kettle on the stove and preparing cups.</seg>
<seg id="176">In the meantime, talked about kádrováckých practices.</seg>
<seg id="177">As one report, often full of praise, they put a man in the arm, and one in which there is any dirt, they send a new employer.</seg>
<seg id="178">But I didn't end up where I was, but on the road with pickaxes and comrades from the factory did not know where to send it.</seg>
<seg id="179">And our personnel manager?</seg>
<seg id="180">That's just old, where what he ate or drank, and so it turned out the way it did.</seg>
<seg id="181">"He takes it from the old," she said mischievously.</seg>
<seg id="182">Today, he certainly won't like it.</seg>
<seg id="183">Still, watch out for him, he is very vindictive.</seg>
<seg id="184">And the party?</seg>
<seg id="185">Essentially, far worse chief, not a philanthropist.</seg>
<seg id="186">Zero from pickaxes with great power.</seg>
<seg id="187">She started to boil water for coffee, and then an office filled with scent is filled with coffee.</seg>
<seg id="188">I threw in a cup of sugar cube and silently stirring the hot potion.</seg>
<seg id="189">I'm out of the woods yet.</seg>
<seg id="190">Now I'm not thrown out and other clearances are up for three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The pinwheel over Chlumem, after years of spinning again.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is far from obvious, because it is located at fifteen meters high mast.</seg>
<seg id="4">People from a wide area they call him "a fan of Chlum."</seg>
<seg id="5">For the community with 150 inhabitants even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which acquired the natives to celebrate the reunion in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We've applied at the time of the character and the fan, we wanted to get into character, of course, he knows everyone in the neighborhood," said Mayor George Masek.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chlumské wind pump is a local technical monument.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is also a reminder of the moment: Recalls a time when the people fought on the quality of drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="9">The one in Chlum in recent centuries has been scarce.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 1910, when they decided to chlumští representatives for a solution, which then suited until the mid 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the village at the junction of Číchov Cave left seven meters deep well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three years later the well completed a metal structure with a pump to pump water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The construction of the Borders, Antonin Fandorin THINKING in Moravia cargo 2 400 crowns," states a commemorative inscription on the ground floor of the mast.</seg>
<seg id="14">The pump after a few repairs and triumphs of the windmill broke down in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="15">On 7 May 1973, then began to write a new chapter in the fight for water: On this day in Chlum began to serve a new pipe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dominating the running at this year's reunion natives.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until 2008, the Chlumští decided to wind the bike repair again and bring up and running again.</seg>
<seg id="19">They produce a replica of the original wheels - reduced by an average of half a metre.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bike was fitted to the mast, the same year, however, had to be put down.</seg>
<seg id="21">The reply, they did not choose a suitable material and the wheel could not resist the wind.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then Chlumska dominant rested for several years dismantled under the roof.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since June of this year, however, the wheel on a tall pole again.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the occasion of the reunion natives community had a replica of the wheels to adjust osadila and returned him to the top of the iron tower.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the bike draws its drinking water from the well only to spill the billabong.</seg>
<seg id="26">And over the summer, we cut it completely, because there was very little water in the well.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was spinning at least.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In the autumn and then the windmill shaft from the pumps in the suction basket off again," the mayor explained Masek.</seg>
<seg id="29">Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where he received a windmill to the municipal character, however, is the only village of its kind in the Highlands.</seg>

<seg id="52">I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their link to the spider had to be caused by the fact that when they see him, he is hidden in a different place and that they are in danger from anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or, maybe they had a telepathic connection with his predator and its rapid disappearance triggered a bewildering response in them.</seg>
<seg id="54">All the more so that no illusions about their vision.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ten utterances of Albert Einstein, which enrich the world.</seg>
<seg id="2">A brilliant scientist of the last century, mankind probably never cease to fascinate.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was able to dive into everything so deep that it was always a figment of astonishing findings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.</seg>
<seg id="5">First came to people's awareness of their special and general theory of relativity, which best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor can we overlook his clarification fotoefektu or the idea of quantization of electromagnetic fields.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no doubt that the mere knowledge deskripce and the popular theory of relativity for many is so convoluted that to elect to get a closer look rather easy comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it would not be Albert Einstein, even if not for this brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour in the vicinity of your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven, it seems an hour - and that is relativity.</seg>
<seg id="10">I took the liberty of his whole variety of famous quotes to choose these ten, which literally mesmerized me.</seg>
<seg id="11">Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, the genius is trying to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two things are infinite.</seg>
<seg id="13">The universe and human stupidity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first one, I'm not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="15">No amount of experimentation can never prove that I was right.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the only time he can prove that I was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is a sad time when it is easier to split the atom than to destroy prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="18">If there is a mess on the table reflects the disarray in the mind, then what reflects an empty desk?</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't know what we'll be fighting in the Third World War, but it will be in the fourth with sticks and stones.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are a thousand ways to kill time, but there is no way to resurrect him.</seg>
<seg id="21">Few know is dangerous and know a lot too.</seg>
<seg id="22">If I had an hour to tackle the problem, which would save my life, I would have spent 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and his solution for 5 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hardest thing in the world to the understanding of the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, I can't forgive myself not to declare the definition of Einstein's formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y and Z rest is to keep your mouth shut.</seg>

<seg id="15">And long overdue zlínskou Baťovu hospital waiting for the construction of a new central income and internal medicine, which will require three quarters of a billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">In all cases, it is a crucial and often the biggest changes in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For the whole region, patients and doctors, it is an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build a hospital director Vera Prousková vsetínské medical ward.</seg>
<seg id="18">Five stories tall, there has to be ready in about two years and offer comfort equipment for medical and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and the intensive care unit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Greater comfort for patients.</seg>
<seg id="20">The changes, which will see significantly more patients, will affect all regions.</seg>
<seg id="21">The new building will replace those in which, for example, there are many sick people in one room, on the floor, they have to be just one bathroom, the beds are nepolohovatelné, leaking windows and the medics do not have adequate conditions for the job.</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, our internal was built 35 years ago and is now on the edge of his life," he pointed out while the hospital director Pavel Calábek.</seg>
<seg id="23">Within a few years it will replace-storey modern building connected with the emergency income.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nobody explained how I had to keep the refugees in the country, if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Interior Minister Milan Volráb (ČSSD), after negotiations with their European colleagues complaining that the Czech Republic is pushing other states to adopt quotas for the relocation of refugees, but they reject any discussion.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also observes that so far no one has explained how they had allocated to keep the refugees in the Czech Republic, if they don't want to live with us anyway.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were removed from the final text," AUTO told journalists.</seg>
<seg id="5">More specifically, can you describe the position that you came to the interior and foreign ministers of the European Union?</seg>
<seg id="6">We disagree with the mandatory quotas as a system that simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="7">We can't talk about migrants as the bags of salt or flour.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are living beings that have some vision, going somewhere, they have some relatives.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want to hear from colleagues, how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States, if redistribuovali.</seg>
<seg id="10">We can't imagine it.</seg>
<seg id="11">We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted to make the quotas were removed from the final text.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, registrars, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="13">We've been talking about it for a year and we say that this is the way.</seg>
<seg id="14">But to say that the quotas will solve everything?</seg>
<seg id="15">Not so long ago we had forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.</seg>
<seg id="16">When it will be five hundred thousand?</seg>
<seg id="17">And how we can keep those people on the territory?</seg>
<seg id="18">Ninety eight per cent of all the people who pass through us, he wants to go to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">Almost no one wants to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, receive azyly for us, but the interest of the people of this wave of migration, namely from Syria and other countries, our race is close to zero.</seg>
<seg id="21">You mentioned that the refugees do not want even to us, but we are fifteen hundred people have already committed to accept.</seg>
<seg id="22">Would it not be possible to accept them this way more?</seg>
<seg id="23">We are committed to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.</seg>
<seg id="24">We said: The functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even in the 1500 that comes 1100 people with whom we deal with asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">They come to our detention facility, and we will treat them as well as to those that we picked up.</seg>
<seg id="27">The big question, and we'll talk about it with Europe, if we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because Europe is acting as if they are registered, they can't be detained.</seg>
<seg id="29">That means, they come to our territory with the registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may be that even the 1100 hold on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they again upon arrival in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="30">If we will be able to hold them for the duration of the asylum procedure, deal with them asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, and almost 98 percent, according to the European statistics receive international protection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.</seg>
<seg id="33">And I think these people will end up again in the target countries.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then there is the four hundred people who will be přesídlovat.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is the second project, which has not yet started, and there we are only in the fact that we are discussing with churches on the possibility that they could help them find employment, housing and so on.</seg>
<seg id="36">But it is a very long haul.</seg>
<seg id="37">You said that at a meeting of ministers in other states were not willing to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="38">But it's not so that only the Czech Republic rejects quotas, but does not offer any joint action that would block the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="39">And what exactly is supposed to be a joint step to you?</seg>
<seg id="40">If the Federal Republic of Germany utters the incentive that all migrants from Syria can get to them, so the message is spreading in the hours after all the camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="41">It encourages the next wave of migration, which seeks to Germany, because they just don't want to us.</seg>
<seg id="42">We think that the journey is the protection of external borders - just to discourage the waves of migration, to help those in need, and to decouple economic migrants.</seg>
<seg id="43">Clearly to let them know that they have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="44">Only in the last year to Germany came fifty thousand Kosovars.</seg>
<seg id="45">From the safety of Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of the state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="46">If we were able to separate them and accept them or take them only according to the needs of the economy, it would be fifty percent of what they are today, social systems in vain, could go to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Compared to the first day, when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is now eighty, on the first day it was twelve.</seg>
<seg id="49">Where it is possible to be tightened border controls?</seg>
<seg id="50">We were afraid of in the order of hundreds of people.</seg>
<seg id="51">These are the numbers that we manage.</seg>
<seg id="52">We still have a few hundred vacancies in the detention facilities.</seg>
<seg id="53">Of course, all of the people that we hold, we will be back within seven days of Austria.</seg>
<seg id="54">We do it by default.</seg>
<seg id="55">The Austrians are the only ones who these people are, with Hungary, it is complicated and the Greeks - that is a completely pointless story.</seg>
<seg id="56">So where is the tipping point?</seg>
<seg id="57">It would have to be a thousand a day?</seg>
<seg id="58">I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.</seg>
<seg id="59">Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days, we will run out of capacity, so much so that contingency plans will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="60">Then I agreed with the Prime Minister, he would immediately called an emergency government.</seg>
<seg id="61">He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="62">If the situation arose, the de facto government can sit immediately and one resolution would have decided to reinforce the army, the police, the customs administration, say, or the prison service.</seg>
<seg id="63">The extreme option is the state of emergency, which in some places now declared Hungary?</seg>
<seg id="64">I think it can't happen to us this far.</seg>
<seg id="65">Please note that our position is different, we are the national state within Europe's Schengen border only at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="66">I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to disseminate the information.</seg>
<seg id="67">All of the information that we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, it indicates that the Hungarians will try to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then imply a direct route to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, hardly at all.</seg>

<seg id="10">Obviously, since the new owners of the money into the club, and at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="11">This shows the expression of Slavie before Tuesday's hearing - vršovický club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, he owed tens of millions of crowns.</seg>

<seg id="2">But it would cost about half a billion more, says an expert from the firm that was designing the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bianca could lead even safer, says an expert.</seg>
<seg id="4">Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there are two drops of soil in the Prague park, says the director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that on Wednesday afternoon during a press tour of the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But according to him, it would have been about half a billion crowns more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always a compromise between price and safety.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The tunnel was lead safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," said Butovič.</seg>
<seg id="10">The conditions in the park were the same to him all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where they began to forge a safer and more cautious method.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If the measures were used about 500 metres before the tunnel would have been about half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.</seg>
<seg id="12">Blanka Tunnel dropped three times during the construction.</seg>
<seg id="13">Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in the park, in 2010, the land fell at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the director of the company Metrostav George Bělohlava tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said repairs.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the original intent of the building had become a 17 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you add the VAT, which popped up twice for the duration of construction, you have 21 from 17 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx profits mixed, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx has reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight services and higher costs for land division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to hire over the holidays about 55,000 seasonal workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shares in the company fell by about 2.5 percent in trading předtržním 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will take effect on January 4, and higher bonuses for the inland transport of heavy or large packages, which start in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "showed a solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rivalská UPS has stated that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 workers in addition, which is about the same as they hired last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is about 6 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, which is smaller than the $2.44. Per share, which was predicted 12 analysts interviewees Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">The six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit by a decline in recent years priority international shipping, which caused that revenue in its Express unit stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the results of FedEx ground troops.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter of the inland revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and their own insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the cargo business due to higher prices for the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="20">In předtržním trading about an hour before the opening FedEx's shares have fallen by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its hottest meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week established at 27 feet long Honduran mahogany table, and they will decide whether the time has come for almost ten years to raise a key interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Towering above them at one end of the depictions of the central bank, a conference room will be a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a double charge of Congress: To maximize American jobs and keep the prices stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to launch at the start of the unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could no longer cautious Fed scare for adding to volatility by increasing its benchmark federal funds rate - even for nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think just looking for an excuse to raise rates, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides sufficient justification to wait any longer," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed does, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists surveyed recently by Blomberg predicted an increase in rates this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, financial markets expect the Fed will delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would have pointed to the decline in the stock market, in the event that the Fed will raise rates only if politicians make the promise that a further increase is in sight.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rally was triggered by expectations that the Fed policymakers hold rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be surprising if the Fed raised rates now," states.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to the limit in its mission statement and hold hands in financial markets, forfeited to panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that the increase in rates would reassure the financial markets, because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only a month ago, it seemed that the Fed is on track to raise rates by 0.25 of a percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said that during the spring and early summer is expected to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals that there is a need for more economic progress.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has experienced strong growth this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.</seg>
<seg id="24">And even if inflation continues to take place under the central bank's 2% target, the Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was a temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world began to struggle at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high value in May, as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy dragged down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market rebounded slightly this month, and the Dow is now only nearly 10% from the peak in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Fed's policymakers unsettled situation in the market adds a complex calculus, when to start raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which they can rely on the latest developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically should not be included in their decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority around the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere suggestion of the then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed would "taper" its monetary expansion in the market, triggered spasms all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are still closely linked, it can be expected that Fed officials are watching the developments elsewhere, but also consults with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in the financial markets, which appear to be inconsistent with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for an increase in rates, citing the decision in 1998-99 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over the three sessions "despite limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during the Great Depression, such as the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen, a former member of the committee setting rates at the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You don't want to be in a situation of fear of growth rates, because the markets are angry," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be at the top.</seg>

<seg id="1">Goodbye, Angela, goodbye old Germany II.</seg>
<seg id="2">Before we go any further on the issue of immigrants, we should remember that the media frenzy around it is managed by professionals.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the needs of the media and also from above.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, let's stop for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies that are in the hands of their parents along dusty roads of an exodus.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that raises a man - in a European man - automatically sense of guilt and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Well, they don't come here just desperate children, you'll notice on the shots landing boats to the Greek islands, the babies on them is not so much to see!</seg>
<seg id="8">Well, we have recently disappeared from the television pictures of ships bound for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, with its beautiful promenade lay out thousands of young men.</seg>
<seg id="9">In large part of young black men.</seg>
<seg id="10">And also disappeared pictures from Calais, where they eat and black men waiting to see whether they will be able to crawl through the tunnel under the English Channel.</seg>
<seg id="11">I guess it doesn't move.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church Eritreans have done a special impression on the people of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Too much of it was falseness.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when it comes to quotas for refugees, and somehow feel that it's not just unfortunate children from Syria, but also the styling - for older: Fashionably vyfešákované - young men.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whose muscles look like they just climbed out of a gym.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only one personal experience.</seg>
<seg id="17">This summer, the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regardless, it was a private, came to the beach at the same time a large group of cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">But no ham.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the young black men.</seg>
<seg id="21">About thirty men and five women.</seg>
<seg id="22">Age between 15 and 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="23">They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes in hand, of course, smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a private beach, is interested, and employees - the Turks, Muslims! - they are clearly worried.</seg>
<seg id="25">Occupy all the couches.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who was on it, and he was in the sea, he was out of luck.</seg>
<seg id="27">They were dressed as the American rapperského film.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wearing a hat with a fingernail, white and coloured Adidas shoes on his feet.</seg>
<seg id="29">Then besieged the local beach bar and began to feast.</seg>
<seg id="30">Occupied tables around, stuffed with brown and white guests seated next to the bar - read Muslims and Europeans, without asking.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="32">Incoming Indians drank beer straight from třetinek - both in the series from the US?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around him.</seg>
<seg id="33">Constantly shouting loudly at each other.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, it was not in English.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then they began to drink wine, straight from the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="36">They jumped into the swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and shouting, mothers with children and pensioners ran away, and for half an hour he was on the beach or in the pool, neither nečerný guest.</seg>
<seg id="37">All disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="38">Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="39">The hotel staff are afraid even to talk about them.</seg>
<seg id="40">The waiter told me in the evening: "Did you see that gold, what they were wearing?"</seg>
<seg id="41">"Yeah," I said.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Well, it certainly did not have a job," said the waiter.</seg>
<seg id="43">I thought: "I know, they all had a massive gold chains around their necks.</seg>
<seg id="44">And one wore a six-inch or so massive cross of gold.</seg>
<seg id="45">And the women were like jewelry store.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are drug smugglers?" I asked.</seg>
<seg id="47">"You saw how they're drinking," the waiter said.</seg>
<seg id="48">Drugs nepašují, or not.</seg>
<seg id="49">Smuggle you something completely different.</seg>
<seg id="50">So for me it was clear what they were smuggling.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, in June, 2105, it still wasn't so important to me.</seg>
<seg id="52">I had no idea what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="53">But the secret services and senior politicians should know it first.</seg>
<seg id="54">It seems to me that they didn't know.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Europe, at the time, about 1.5 million immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="56">And they come and they go and go.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today, it turned out that the European Union's main problem is that it's totalitarian-political-correct politicians, intellectuals and linked them to lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="58">Germany and its politicians - now publicly acknowledged the main force in Europe - they lie, lie and lie - but not only them, as well as EU leaders and television, including ours.</seg>
<seg id="59">For example, the recent television images of an enthusiastic welcoming refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow television images from August 1968.</seg>
<seg id="60">Of course, there were a few sluníčkářů at the station, but mainly - staroněmečtí - Muslims welcomed their brethren.</seg>
<seg id="61">The long weeks squealed in reports on Czech television, how they are, according to some research, almost all of the Germans for the arrival of emigrants.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, who was only a few days in Germany, he knows that it is a lie.</seg>
<seg id="63">Which confirm more information.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, the famous poll organized ARD - Czech Association of public television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="65">According to the ARD wanted a week ago, more than 50% of Germans to accept more refugees.</seg>
<seg id="66">It also meldovaly our TV.</seg>
<seg id="67">They have withheld, however, what's the next day in Germany: That the anketním vote to the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans want no more immigrants - 67 000 people took part in the survey.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts to use multi-use very sophisticated society has failed completely."</seg>
<seg id="69">Then she said: "Germany gives up the fight for a multicultural society."</seg>
<seg id="70">"All the efforts of such coexistence completely failed."</seg>
<seg id="71">In a country where there are four million Muslims, according to her failed strategy that people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side, without having to integrate. They live here with us today, and we've been deluding ourselves for a while, that will one day disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="72">But that is not the reality.</seg>
<seg id="73">Multicultural approach, when we say that just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.</seg>
<seg id="74">Completely failed.</seg>
<seg id="75">But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.</seg>
<seg id="76">It shows the escalation of events.</seg>
<seg id="77">The conflict is increasing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly held doesn't even have a high school diploma - yes, that is the one in the EU parliament, Berlusconi said that he could play a guard in a concentration camp by the minute - as demonstrated again.</seg>
<seg id="79">It seems, especially in the wake of the recent statements by German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.</seg>
<seg id="80">Note that except for some, most European politicians does not support these statements, leaders of countries that were victims of Nazism, they are horrified.</seg>
<seg id="81">What happened with the Germans?</seg>
<seg id="82">With the rich, successful and solid Germans?</seg>
<seg id="83">Who tried for years to, at least outwardly, to deal with his terrible past the aggressor and killer of millions?</seg>
<seg id="84">They are right, those who say that the devil in the soul of Germany is seeded aggression, superiority and violence?</seg>
<seg id="85">He was right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, with all your might stop Velkoněmců attempts to dominate the entire centre of Europe?</seg>
<seg id="86">When he said that the idea of the Great German Germany?</seg>
<seg id="87">I had.</seg>
<seg id="88">When it was impounded, she began preparing for the First World War.</seg>
<seg id="89">The idea of Velkoněmecka, who led the Germans and Europe into two wars, which cost millions of lives, is likely to come back in a different form.</seg>
<seg id="90">After the attempt by the Marxists to dominate the state, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, for example, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main philosophical doctrine of Nazism, she began to develop a new German ideology.</seg>
<seg id="91">We told the Pollyanna.</seg>
<seg id="92">The German elite has long prevented the emergence of German nationalism, and then left alone all the fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our les must live.</seg>
<seg id="93">To satisfy the restless young people all over the world, they want to do something different and better, fully opted on the side of the fighters against the warming of the planet, nuclear power plants, etc.</seg>
<seg id="94">And forget that in this stream is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so to speak - and antislovanský propalestinský stream of treating all Slavs in the difficult thing - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of a Jew, he was mostly a German nationalist.</seg>
<seg id="95">And also, as shown by recent statements by Schulz and German ministerial openly threatening responses rebellious eastern states, the idea vůdcovského Germany.</seg>
<seg id="96">To be to listen without argument.</seg>
<seg id="97">Otherwise, woe to you!</seg>
<seg id="98">And when the mix that immigrants are very suggestible group of voters, we have what we have.</seg>
<seg id="99">And, as always, is behind this capital, especially the German, who is comfortable and who could benefit from the fact that Germany and the European Union over the bank actually controls most of the nations of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduced the Germans to the swamps ekologismu and multiklturalismu and brought them home today and maybe even bring millions of Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="101">Who, lured by the voices of the sirens, early on the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and they begin to revolt.</seg>
<seg id="102">Germany can only threaten its neighbors again force can once again part of its inhabitants - but it seems increasingly smaller part - poblouznit ideologically, but eventually it catches up with the reality, as always.</seg>
<seg id="103">Germany will burn again?</seg>
<seg id="104">Muslim hostels already burning.</seg>
<seg id="105">What does the German government and the German public protests against the incoming Islamists?</seg>
<seg id="106">Who will come to help Muslims living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not asimilovaní to take over the local customs and laws?</seg>
<seg id="107">What does the German government when it came to blows naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans fear the Islamisation of their country?</seg>
<seg id="108">What it will do to the Germans, and even with Germany to pick up people who are loudly and publicly to protest against the new euro-Superman Muslim?</seg>
<seg id="109">Germany has just changed.</seg>
<seg id="110">The conflict, which has caused in Europe by promoting sluníčkářské ideology, which is elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and their greedy banks, is growing.</seg>
<seg id="111">And because of the omission of recalcitrant democratic Germans and all the underprivileged and rebellious eastern neighbours can't turn out well.</seg>

<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, states.</seg>

<seg id="1">For moderately obese diabetics could be useful for weight loss surgery</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it is still too early to say whether the moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving nonsurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new JAMA study of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Operations for weight loss surgery bariatrické use different methods to reduce the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reducing hunger and the limitations of the human body to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatrické operation proved effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was carried out on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, which measures the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the values of between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or higher is overweight people and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For their new study, the researchers used the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study from 2007, which deals with two types of bariatrické surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy The - in medical treatments of type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who underwent surgery, according to a study has fallen from 31% to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the meantime, BMI were those who did not receive surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly equal to the value of 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among patients with diabetes was resolved completely operations at 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medication group was treated for diabetes resolved completely compared with only 1 percent, and only partly in about 2 percent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="16">It also was the control of blood pressure, trigylceridů and "bad" LDL cholesterol demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is best to maintain haemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, the researchers stated.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average value of the haemoglobin A1c has dropped from about 9 percent to around 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">The group treated with medication, however, this value has remained at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in the higher levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fifth year of the bypass group lost more weight compared with the group gastrectomy The (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studies of the stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolong life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College or Medicine - Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Swedish study were obese people who underwent bariatric surgery, about 29 percent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared with a group who tried to more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Right here, this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without an increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone also claims that the people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a decline in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we are waiting too long with the people expressing the gravity of the situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes that tightly integrate their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the road back is already really heavy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe is not able to accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama has addressed the question of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He claimed that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also pointed out that the response of Western European countries, whether it was in any way admirable, the refugee crisis has been inadequate in this situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible that all come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, stressed that this is only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Take care of a few thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime, you have to think about the long term solution to bring real peace and real development, particularly through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.</seg>

<seg id="38">I can't say that I'm really objective.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody says that the organisers tried to spy on him and threatening to close factories</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria stewards that he tried to get a spy into the barn last year and threatened to immediately put an end to the racing.</seg>
<seg id="3">He focused on the organisers and the integrity of the Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratch Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which for him on Wednesday was the last straw.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he was always trying to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation in terms of Lidarin positive swab to cobalt, which can explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He bit his tongue on charges of spying for 18 months and did not want it to look like a "dry grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I sat on it for a long time, but I just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at once," said Moody.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know that it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, I'm going to go home and I'll sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk with my head up and to think that I'm doing the best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When you start to think the opposite, then it shouldn't be a coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would have to consider what to do after their licences.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moody released earlier in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call on the issue - and offered him a job in my stables to find out information about the things that are in my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course, they thought I was a crook.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is so, they should show all your information, because they failed in an attempt to catch me completely.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, a former chairman of NI, David Moodie, the current chairman of the NI, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of NI, which at the time were aware of, and are aware of that even today.</seg>
<seg id="18">I should think that it becomes a personal matter?</seg>
<seg id="19">She keeps the NI grow some balls and arrange for people outside of the coaching position taken responsibility for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm bad for this industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm really so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe the people here think so.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe I need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I say now will provide them with the material to ponder.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I got to the point when it doesn't matter to me, and I'm sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'll push them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The coach's frustration levels increase with long term investigations for cobalt, including Lidari and recent scratches made him feel that he could "hours of your license on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mood, best known for designing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule of treatment on race day as "ridiculous" after he was injected the horses up clay tiles or mud, which is against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="33">It could be the last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">It happened on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody faced a three month disqualification for the treatment of tiles on the day of the race, which the organisers have already opened an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">The people who create these rules, doesn't know anything about horses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals for wrestling claim</seg>
<seg id="2">Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of their players as "the plan" two NRL premiership favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said that the referee allowed players Storm "wrestlovat" his players during the team's controversial victory Storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a veiled comment on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game as a "parade" rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were "too big" for wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during those focused on "contact."</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence, because his team is criticized by two senior coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat from the Storm.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It still comes - I don't remember Trent Robinson talked about wrestling, when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we haven't changed in the last year none of our defensive system and techniques, the last few weeks we've only emphasized contact during the crackdown, and that was the turning point for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been here for three years and obviously a great team coaches, so it is probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetovův team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about the exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was right in his Saturday game was as exciting as ours, it was just as exciting, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010, St George were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he could care less.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play the style of game that feels exciting, especially his young midfielders with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want to play the kind of football, if you have access to this type of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said this view in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play his style of football teams - but not every team has two linebackers such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play the style.</seg>
<seg id="18">It makes me more confidence, because they say such things because they are worried about the game against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, probably wouldn't even think about us, when they get to the big matches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and Roosters have fallen more wickets than in a game the Broncos and the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos team game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game is over 20-18, in our game, there were two more attempts, but it is an exciting football?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are they break and neskórování experiments that interesting?</seg>
<seg id="24">To me, it's the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you mention us, it means that at some stage we will meet again.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park, tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht Solay, who arrived from South America through Vanuatu and in August, docked in Coomer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger also stressed for Wilshere, it is still only September and, if his rehab goes according to plan, there is no reason for him to play again on Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The best case scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship, is clearly uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">Too bad this nnejnovějšího problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury, and then got back into the former forms during předsezóny.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This type of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a wound that requires treatment.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not about nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not even his ankle injury, which he suffered before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That might be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury, whenever any player returns during the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also an unpleasant formula.</seg>
<seg id="12">A survey conducted by the Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries Wilshera since six years ago, he had his game debut.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the last five years, he played in only 65 league games arsenal out of a total of 157:</seg>
<seg id="14">From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 was one of two clubs in the Premier League, who lost the most days because of the injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of the recorded injuries during the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you're coming back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and to win the competition," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope that his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does, and will have the career they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="19">Campaign begins with Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches on Saturday, with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, it means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudem instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players who need it, to breathe," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even if Arsenal is the clear favourite to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dinamo also been defeated in a total of 41 games after last season to keep the campaign "unbeatable."</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium on Wednesday night earthquake shook 3.2 degrees Richter.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was in Zagreb for the tenth time this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco, and he remains a distant hope to lead the club to a first victory in the European Cup.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This deployment is huge," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">Arsenal it never happened.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: Comedy show, which gives us a serious lesson about male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of a similar view in different show is striking, especially given how men are needed to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicides among young men in 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Great Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to solve this problem, identified the Campaign Against Living matter (CALM) 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men to seek help if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the heart of this fight is the friendship to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that, in the event that the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "good mood," their chances of recovery has doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends half a chance on the incidence of mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the friendship to work, of course, must be achieved as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to our digital lives, health, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are in reality rather isolated.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call the external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as recently explained one billionaire and creator of games, money really can't buy greater happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of the show Friends was the source of this idea for him.</seg>
<seg id="14">None of the characters was not defined by their work, but their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.</seg>
<seg id="15">Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on the comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the knowledge that, yes, men can also identify with it, although I usually keep your feelings to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a kindly worker explained to me:... "my role as an audience of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies, I really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interaction can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us, often feel the inability to communicate with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about the problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends are one of the programs that arise in my mind when I'm trying to offer a longer term compensation mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="20">Highlights the small moments in the male friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone to help people in moments of despair, but long term support must come from a closer look, from a network of friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend hosted by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely rewritten to celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what a difference it can make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Television show "Friends" will be broadcast on Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="8">But even when they got the three points, it was not a classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan was put in front of the gate of the prodigal and later was replaced against his home team and the club where he started his storied career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Champions League is not easy to win out or at home, so a win 2-0 makes our adversaries problems and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things that we have to improve with the passage of the season," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">That is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we have won, but I regret that we nevstřelili for one or two more wickets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put back after injury as one of three changes to the team of PSG, who took home this weekend draw 2-2 with Bordeaux in the League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing has been identified as the man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level since his move from Manchester United, which took place last month, and he showed why, when he ran to pass Marco Verrattiho for defending Malm and a beautiful finish behind Johan Wilanda sent the ball into the far corner of the goal.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone expected that it will kick off a spectacular victory of PSG, had to be disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, which beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, came with 9 International in the starting lineup and five defenders and two closed reservists were a tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in addition to the missiles Nikola Djurdjice, who only just missed the far corner of the goal of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, it didn't offer much in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG were stripping themselves for the benefit of the poor přihrávkami and miserable endings, which was not good either from Ibrahimovice, who couldn't even shot five times in the first half, and then was disappointed because his shot into the net arrived shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he showed a much more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates, and it was just out of his passes, when Di Maria sent rotational missile, which ended in Wilandově goal after 52 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanimu, the Uruguayan sent the banner over the line for the sixth goal of the season after he put a pass after pass from the left wing from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any thoughts of Malm on the possibility that they could get something from the game, and only an excellent save from a nearby Wilanda dashed the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged, even at a time when the goal of relieving Ezequiel Lavezziho unacceptable at the end of the game.</seg>
<seg id="21">Team Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifying matches is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">I take my hat off to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="25">For them, it was a fascinating game.</seg>

<seg id="1">As the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="2">Emergency flares fired by Germany nearly nestmelila European crew, but it makes the ship to change course, he wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.</seg>
<seg id="3">The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: There will be more systematically sort of migrants and asylum seekers, as soon as he steps on the old continent - especially in Greece to argue for the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on the quantity that is increasingly remote from reality.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six days after the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said 25 of the 28 EU countries, in order to reallocate 160,000 refugees, changed the interior ministers of the Member States priority.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rather than worrying about the final destination of migrants, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for the management of migration," stresses the text projednaném ministers in Brussels on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the crisis, the EU's common currency notes that it is in danger in his next big integration project.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany may be surprised, but does not lose their decisiveness and increases the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="9">Restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in this country.</seg>
<seg id="10">Central power that makes clear that, without it, there is no freedom of movement in Europe is possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">He served as proof that Austria and Slovakia on Monday joined on the measure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France have been thinking about it, albeit with varying intensity.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hungary has already been introduced to a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">This exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the rules of the Schengen.</seg>
<seg id="15">That it is a domino effect, but also blind.</seg>
<seg id="16">The key question for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed into the interior.</seg>
<seg id="17">French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière about intensive talks during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="18">This idea is not new, but there is stiff.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Italy, according to unofficial statistics were already recorded and identified with taking fingerprints two thirds of newly arrived refugees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because they fear more than others on her shoulders were camps in which the refugees massing on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="21">A real black hole remains Greece.</seg>
<seg id="22">On its islands near the Turkish coast landed this year, more than 200,000 people, which is more than twice recently arrived in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is a huge, gaping hole.</seg>
<seg id="25">Athens, which are still in the financial collapse and that they are waiting for a new government, his hands folded in his lap.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is the starting point for the Balkan route and now a source of common concern for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</seg>
<seg id="27">Juncker's Commission promises to establish control points will occur as soon as possible, but gave no number or date.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The challenges facing Greece, apply to the whole of Europe," they agreed on Monday, EU interior ministers to mobilize on this front.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is therefore necessary to deploy SWAT teams in this country, the European border control agency Frontex.</seg>
<seg id="30">The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers and to strengthen the supervision of the islands.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It will require adequate financial resources," warns the text presented to ministers for approval.</seg>
<seg id="32">From the perspective of the law will continue to have the last word in Athens.</seg>
<seg id="33">The question of the actual European border guards had not been officially raised, but that Europe is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new emergency 28s anyway pushed to one side the question of mandatory quotas and 160,000 refugees who have already signalled the beginning of Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Consider it as an attack on its sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="37">The number, but not the obligation, on Monday was maintained in the text approved by the majority of 28s.</seg>
<seg id="38">But as a political commitment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In other words, the process is interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="40">The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already reached an agreement in June during the hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Insurance companies should pay for the demands of clients in the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday, the House decided to approve the revised amendments to the law on the conditions of business in tourism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Travel agents will be able to draft, which is headed to the Senate for consideration, to replace the insurance against the collapse of a bank guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="5">Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the demands of clients and above the agreed limit does not agree.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry for Regional Development to adjust lasts, argues consumer protection.</seg>
<seg id="7">Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel insurance against a collapse when the amendments will apply.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the proposal also criticise the travel office.</seg>
<seg id="9">Without insurance, they will have to either quit or leave the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">Minister for Local Development Charles P. (YES) argued that the cases where insurance companies did not pay off the full refunds are not eurokomformní.</seg>
<seg id="11">Draw attention to this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the level of coverage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, P. pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We appreciate the efforts to improve consumer protection, but there must be a limit to be viable," said Vice President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to him, bank guarantees will not work, because no one can give it unlimited.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Travel agents will have to terminate its activities or move abroad," Kalousek said.</seg>
<seg id="16">A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalouskovými fears based on a survey among Member CK disagreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The insurance company does not consider Okamura as relevant, none of their official written statement to that effect, according to him, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="19">But they are exploring whether the travel agency will consist of complicity, which according to Okamura is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="20">Before the provision also warned Jan Fischer (ODS), which referred to the competitive position of the travel office of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about deleting the Czech travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Travel agents, according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Consumer protection is working," says Fischer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Its proposal to launch the disputed passages of the House did not approve.</seg>
<seg id="24">Failed even Vojtech Filip (KSČM) with a proposal to return the draft to the committee for alleged violation of the Civil Code.</seg>
<seg id="25">Philip drew attention to the travel agency, which according to him, they can threaten the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rapporteur draft Martin Berdychová (YES) due to the verdict of the Constitutional Court had withdrawn its proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance will not cover the entire risk.</seg>
<seg id="27">The amendment will not initially proposed minimum čtyřmilionový limit insurance for travel agencies that offer tours by air, and the dollar limit for the seller's office, for example, bus tours.</seg>
<seg id="28">The borders will remain at 30 percent of the revenue from the sale of tours.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the limit of insurance coverage will have to be such that in the event of bankruptcy travel agents to cover all the demands of customers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even after adjustments to the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to travel in the new state, which is organised by a travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="31">Travel agents will have to submit insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, including data on the economy and the number of trips.</seg>
<seg id="32">The amendment approved by the Committee for Public Administration counts with another regular informing the insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="33">Travel agents each month, they will have to provide data on the number of passengers and tours sold, for a total price of tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for tours and for vouchers to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">If the Ministry for Regional Development finds that the travel agency did not meet any of the statutory duty to the insurance company, according to the draft to invite him to remedy or she will be able to enter into new contracts if the infringement could endanger the interests of customers.</seg>
<seg id="35">The amendment also has a newly adjusted funding of mountain services.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Ministry for Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be administered by the end of April for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="37">The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, the financial expenditure plan and outlook for the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to the promoter of the law but not the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the contract.</seg>
<seg id="39">She will not be allowed to organise tours and clients who have purchased their trip before the termination of the insurance, so they come to him, according to the association.</seg>
<seg id="40">CK will suffer a significant loss in such a case, and can even fail, even though its economy was in good shape.</seg>
<seg id="41">One of the ways to deal with such a situation can travel agents, the action will be in the state for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">Another option would be to move abroad and the use of much softer conditions abroad and in our market, then we will act only as an agency, the Association Vice President John Pope said.</seg>
<seg id="43">The draft amendment, according to him, it also contains the bank guarantees, but the pitches so that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantees cannot be played on an unlimited amount.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to the association is also changing the current practice of de facto useless.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the next two years will be necessary due to the new EU directive to revise the law again.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.</seg>
