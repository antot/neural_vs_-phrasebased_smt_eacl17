ten of the last eleven nation poll show donald trump with a double-digit lead , and some begin to serious ask what it 's chanc for the nomin of the real-est mogul .
of cours , it is still too earli in the term .
no one claim that trump is like to win the republican nomin .
expert stress that it was at this time in 2011 by rick perri 's leadership to the rise herman cain , none of which also won onli one state in the nomin process .
and there are mani reason whi he would have to fight in a general elect .
but outsid group such as jeb bush 's super pac and the conserv group club for growth economi now see trump 's persever and begin to make their dollar go to overthrow him .

by mid-juli , there were 40 percent .
at the begin of august , there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 republican have a posit view of donald trump .
about three in ten say they have a negat opinion .
and these figur are in earli state .
a quinnipiac-vot in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republican have a posit opinion of trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as the gop candid .
in a cnn / orc poll last week , 67 percent of republican said they were either `` enthusiast '' or `` satisfi '' if trump were nomin .

republican voter get use to the idea .
if they put their scholar hat , republican voter think trump is for real .
when they are ask who is most like to win the gop nomin , accord to a cnn / orc poll from last week , four out of ten that trump is the best bet .
this is a chang from the time when four out of ten at the end of juli put their money on jeb bush .
full disclosur : gop voter had in the past , not the clearest crystal ball .
at this stage in the last cycl , four out of ten republican thought that rick perri will win the nomin , compar to onli 28 % were for the final candid mitt romney .
howev , it appear that a larg number of gop voter , trump 's campaign as a plausibl .
even if the republican gather around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some expert suggest that the splinter field probabl contribut to trump 's leadership , while the anti-trump-support to more than a dozen other candid distribut is diffus .

still , trump 's strongest competitor at the moment , the other outsid , the neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who say that they have made up their mind are twice as often for trump .
six out of 10 republican say they agre with trump on the issu of immigr .
sinc then , donald trump in his campaign speech two month ago immigr from mexico as `` rapist '' who call immigr , was the lynchpin in the public discours on 2016 .
some are concern that the bombast languag of trump crucial hispan from the republican parti will keep and will damag the neuorientierungs-effort .
but accord to the new abc / post poll on monday said six out of 10 republican , with trump on immigr issu .
so , as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , it will also do donald trump appar .
the frustrat with the govern climb to new high .

six out of 10 republican said monday in the new abc / post poll , they want a polit outsid rather than someon with govern experi .
and they are also angri at washington .

as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip of rate hike could make thing volatil for a while .
onc it arriv , the impact is not so dramat .
`` there seem to be a tendenc for asset return of 12 to 24 month after the first increas will be undermin , perhap again reflect the delay in monetari polici , '' said deutsch bank analyst in a recent studi of what happen after the fed 's interest-r increas .
more specif , the market is most over the last 35 year in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike , pretti flat over the next 250 day ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 day , with an averag rate of return over the past six past cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi , bob doll , chief invest strategist at nuveen asset manag , publish in barron 's .
deutsch bank said that the impact on the share tend to occur later in the cycl , and thus increas the yield begin to decreas .
recess are a fact of econom life , but they often promot interest rate hike .
in the current case , the fed is face with a number of condit , which did not exist befor and which could hasten a recess .
most remark is that gdp is near it lowest point in a rate hike by the fed .
accord to deutsch bank 's nomin gdp stood at 118 rate hike onli twice sinc 1950 under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent , onli a few , and we expect that this will continu in the third quarter , accord to the atlanta fed just 1.5 percent .
interest rate increas in such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and rais the question of `` whether it is differ this time , '' said deutsch bank .
market particip throughout the year on a rate hike by the fed have been taken , and all eye were on the meet of the feder open market committe address this week , which end on thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ that the fomc increas could approv dure this session , the futur trade is onli a probabl of 25 percent .
`` in our studi , all have cycl increas from 1950 to today in a super-cycl with increas momentum in gdp and pre-recess high veri quick after the start of the recoveri in the shade provid , '' accord to the report .
in contrast , this is clear a slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the observ period .
the current cycl is by far the longest , the fed has been wait sinc the end of the last recess , the record was 35 month , and there have been 74 month .
the fix incom was also volatil , becaus the market is anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is quit similar to the capit market .
the main differ is that the effect on bond is faster than stock if the chang their strateg direct .
with bond yield seem to chang direct as soon as the first increas / decreas in the cycl .
at the end of the cycl of increas bond yield fall , deutsch bank said .
charl schwab 's strategist believ that the rise in interest rate will caus bond yield between longer and shorter closer togeth and lead to a flatten of the curv .
high-yield bond often bring better return in such a climat , although `` we are still cautious , to expect higher yield , '' said kathi jone , fixed-incom analyst at schwab , in an analysi .
it is interest that jone believ that the market are alreadi in fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength of the dollar and the declin in inflat expect , there are some sign that the market to the prospect of tighter monetari polici has chang , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate have risen , the yield curv is flat , credit spread have widen and volatil has risen - all characterist of the market , when the fed tighten it strategi .
by and larg , compani that handl the greater part of their busi in the us , will benefit if interest rate rise and local product are more attract .
multin compani with high debt will be wors off , as a rise dollar make their product more expens on the global market , as well as the financ of their debt .
`` histori show that '' qualiti `` stock tend , three month after an initi rate hike to respond veri posit , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report to client .
compani with strong balanc sheet have surpass compani with weak balanc sheet after each of the interest rate hike in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on averag , by 5 percentag point .
compani with high capit return and low volatil in their share exceed their counterpart with lower qualiti ( by an averag of 4 percentag point ) , and 3 ( percentag point ) .
debt is a big problem .
compani with a high proport of flexibl interest rate will lose the most , goldman said .
outsid of the pure stock game consum also will benefit from the rise dollar .
saver could see profit through higher yield , although expert are divid on how soon that will happen .

sure david cameron the lorax know better ?
there is one thing that all parent will soon learn : if your child love a book , it will not be long befor you know it almost by heart .
unless you are perhap david cameron .
as a provid of childcar system was ask his favorit children 's book , the prime minist opt for the lorax , publish in 1971 environment fabl of dr. / he .
it is a difficult choic , cameron wrote in a messag on the websit of the compani super camp , and continu : `` it was funni , move , creativ and with a power messag , it is a book that i read to my children , becaus it alway seem to be an imag or a messag that we ve been miss . ''
all well and good , except that the follow paragraph in which cameron alleg describ the plot of the book , but a summari of the film version of 2012 , the new charact and detail ad to the relat short text .
`` in the midst of the wall citi of thneed-vill , where all natur is gone and the air is a commod , is hope for a boy name ted , the heart of audrey , the girl of his dream to win by their desir to see a real tree , '' read one . dr. / he was a love interest , whose real name was theodor / he hostag and die in 1991 , but complet unknown .
as if that were n't suspici enough : the text propos by cameron read , in part , as the summari of the lorax 's film , on the websit of the internet movi databas , and so begin : `` in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where everyth is artifici and even the air is a commod , hope a boy name ted , the heart of audrey , the girl of his dream to win . ''
although he admit to be a pragmat father , it seem unlik that cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar , hear an unnam boy , as the local environ by the greedi , tree case , thneed knit once-l , despit the protest of the name lorax , hock , schnurrbärtigen natur , `` that '' speak on behalf of the tree , is devast .
most like , it was such a relat low pr task deleg to a helper , the lorax not 20 time in a row , read to a child .
a down street spokeswoman said that the text probabl come from cameron 's constitu offic .
super camp confirm that the text was suppli by cameron 's staff , but had no further immedi comment .
adam lyth was clear at risk of exclus from the england team , but it is still difficult
against pakistan in the unit arab emir , is a difficult task , but if the squad that was select for the tour of england , is a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat on my card .
`` i would not rule out a victori .
alastair cook 's side may have less than three year ago , but there are good player of spin in the bat and field , and the communiti spirit is strong ; they will bear no scar of 2012 , onli a youth , posit attitud .
with the ball , moeen ali as a spin-bowl and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , is an option for the attack .
in relat news : adam lyth leav england test squad and will be replac by alex was .
the decis to leav adam lyth , of cours , is for me to analyz as his head coach in yorkshir .
in his seven test , there were two good attack under difficult condit , and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are focus on result .
there was no question mark at joe root , for exampl , that led to the nomin - and i have said this befor - player are their own best chooser .
long ago , it would have extend the run of lyth , but he had control of his own destini .
hope , if he beat out more run for yorkshir , anoth chanc .
the england coach trevor bayliss prais his attitud , even if he is not so good servic , and this doe not surpris me ; he is first and foremost a team man .
the question of how much time a test-shot man get to his charact , is difficult .
lyth had seven chanc - as sam robson got in front of him - while nick compton nine .
onli compton got the chanc to play home and away .
the onli critic i can make is that england was jonathan routin first began in the caribbean - as lyth in top shape - but that lost opportun is now in the past .
alex disast come in , and he is a man , and i have .
he is an x-factor-cricket in yorkshir we saw earli in this season , when he 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch was what hit us .
he must be at least the same opportun as those in front of him , but this of cours depend on the line-up in the unit arab emir .
the idea of let moeen alongsid cook beat what an extra spin-bowl and provid four quick would receiv , and i have noth against it .
i do not see whi a man could not beat , and this left-hand has alreadi shown that he is a vicious bastard of cricket player .
moeen has perhap done his job for his counti worcestershir , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no differ .
my former teammat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop , befor he appear in 2001 as an open .
he has manag three hundr run immedi and not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner , and in my limit deal with him , he has impress me as a young man .
peopl might look at his statist , an averag of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there is no larg number of backup spinner who rais their hand and the coach have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the england team has made a few clever addit to the coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman out , as a consult for the test match could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guy in the game who will bring a wealth of experi , have play in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood for the white-bal stage of the tour and will bring energi and a power presenc in the setup .
i alway felt that he was on the intern cricket competit is creat , as a player or as a coach , and how he had mahela insight from which we can benefit .
sometim , new voic can bring a breath of fresh air in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with the previous said .
colli teammat at durham , ben stoke , is not in the one-day , root receiv a similar break against australia and , for my part , i have no problem with that .
some will not agre , but coach and team director do not determin the timet .
and you must rememb that their job depend on the player from the result .
such decis are taken not with a light heart .
the brexit camp = brexit ( british exit from the eu ) are gain popular as the economi by the year 2017 is in the doldrum
david cameron 's half-bak neuverhandlung strategi in order to keep britain in the eu , with each day deeper into troubl , even without the choic of the brilliant jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn for leader of labour and the tuc , becaus europ was renown on tuesday .
foreign also have their corbyn 's and nigel farag 's .
a european diplomat friend said the other day that some member state , so deepli enmesh in various crise , such as the eu , it is now , and not alway through their own fault , britain 's own agenda with divid concess and disrupt chang that they are not usual like that .
in brighton , the tuc decid at their annual meet that it may not be them if they threaten social protect .
we could also have dave and georg selfie-agenda .
prime minist and minist of financ climb summit and bilater meet in foreign capit , a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local size , then come home and say that they win alli for reform .
it is alway about me .
my european friend , an outwards-look britain insid the eu tent want - `` let us not just with franc , '' say berlin - and hint that more and more short-sight minist and offici in some capit came to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
germani 's care prudent chancellor angela merkel is an alli , but it has been in power for 10 year and want to leav the offic befor it look bad for them , such as lunchtim of those like thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand and kohl ( 14 ) ( 16 is in the over long ) .
franc 's françoi holland look back on his re-elect or it replac in 2017 .
he is also a declin forc .
poland may soon have a nationalist right-w govern , spain left .
it is hard to imagin that they will bend over backward to help the selfie-briton , whose energi should be use more , scotland 's exit from the uk - to prevent someth they may not want to , becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so mayb some of these minist are plan even deliber unhelp comment , snp-style , while britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to acceler the process of brexit , thought my friend .
`` the renegoti was a bust , '' and `` britain has won noth of valu from the renegoti . ''
european know how predatori the fleet street can be at their expens and the eu sceptic is the oligarchi of the press baron , as they did dure the referendum in 1975 , inspir by toni benn were not , howev , that our entri in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can be weak to bori johnson , the ore-euro opportunist , who has a reput as an eu `` straight banana '' brussel correspond in the earli 1990s .
for all it crazi ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
this includ a medley of tax-fearing-rogu , phone-hack of foreign and the pseudo-non-resid who own most of our major newspap .
toni blair realli thought much about it , but note that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distribut banana to distract him , rather than on his lunch and dinner .
in fact , miliband was more blairian as blair himself when he resist cameron 's referendum , becaus blair had not adopt the principl of the eu constitut , which was reject by french and dutch voter in 2005 , he open the back door .
the press has never forgiven him. ``
but the nice jeremi corbyn , of me in westminst on monday for a friend slap on the back - i told him that he had no time for me to wast need - seem in danger of neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of 80 year to repeat a mistak then and now .
it may be , but he need to develop a coher strategi in order to win over the media , not with me , but certain with andrew , whose bbc sofa he left on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit on europ is - i express it polit - in develop .
he say that we should remain in a reform eu .
now , most peopl outsid of ukip tradit blue dye-tend and the wilder clime of tori klein-engländerismus can say yes to everyon .
it is to admit it , `` said hilari benn , not a bennit '' benn on the radio and on televis this week , when the scout fought in it , not that corbyn 's appoint of provoc john mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it remind me of the 1970s , when his old father on televis what , disloy to his labour cabinet colleagu , without go too far and lose his cabinet job .
hilari fight was even more attract .
but struggl to remain `` under ani circumst '' - benn - was not what mcdonnel said , nor what jc and his colleagu told deleg after all the report on their conclav on monday even .
whatev the mawkish bottom-up imag of corbyn want to convey - rememb that even he has move me - news-disciplin remain in the age of tv around the clock , and , abov all , in the maelstrom of social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it is right to give cameron a free ticket to europ , which allow him to labour 's support in the referendum campaign to keep a foregon conclus , as mcdonnel , it said .
sure simon jenkin think so .
but mcdonnel and corbyn 's fundament ambigu to eu membership - in line with it bennit belagerungs-economi , it anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among left-w dissid , for whom the narciss of small differ a central principl of dogmat disput .
as with all it ambigu to nato - tom watson is absolut convinc that jc is launch a campaign to leav - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to find a sens of their superior .
whi pari or berlin should wast polit capit - they have to make distrust voter - to make concess to the british , if anyth can be meaningless ?
the us is alreadi quit disappoint by the lack of militari servic in iraq , libya and syria , even with a reduct in the tori govern in power , how do i start on monday was reminisc of someth , which is call british influenc secur forum .
expert criticis report by public health england on e-cigarett
a government-fund agenc claim that e-cigarett are less harm than smoke emerg from a meet of 12 peopl , some with tie to the tobacco industri , said research .
expert in the british medic journal ( bmj ) , join in the lancet , by public health england ( phe ) in it report on e-cigarett are use as evid .
phe report publish the `` principl '' last month and describ him as a `` comprehens review of the evid . ''
but some research have call into question the reliabl of the data , and highlight the link between some of the expert and the tobacco industri .
an editori in the medic journal lancet last month attack the `` extrem windi basi , '' reason on the phe his main conclus .
two other research write in bmj and ask whether the alleg `` on stone or sand build up . ''
martin mckee , professor of european öffentlichd health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin and simon cape , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
you said that the public expect of phe 's assert that `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' on a detail review of the evid and the model are base .
in fact , this statement come from a singl meet of 12 peopl who were conven to make a model of a multi-criteria decis analysi ( multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) to develop their opinion about the damag caus by a varieti of nicotine-contain product to lead to a synthesi ; the result of the meet were summar in a research report .
mckee and cape well said that a sponsor of the meet was a compani call euro swiss health , whose ceo is earlier by british american tobacco ( bat ) to have an independ studi .
he also sign the credenti of bat for public health in a sustain report , they said .
one of the 12 particip in the meet said that fund from an e-cigarett manufactur , but not the fund , which he previous after report from tobacco compani philip morri intern is said to have receiv , she ad .
the reason for the select of the member of the board are not suppli , but that includ sever well-known e-cigarette-champion , some of whom even an industri fund in the paper .
some of the other particip in the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
at the meet , also took the tobacco-of phe .
the research group `` signific , '' recogn that there is a lack of hard evid of the damag of most product on most criteria , `` wrote , mckee and cape .
but none of these compound or restrict in the phe report discuss .
mckee and cape well said that the alleg of phe that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett as a way of smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said that it was respond to the alleg by the bmj earlier .
he said : `` e-cigarett are much less harm than smoke . ''
everi second lifelong smoker die of his addict .
all the evid suggest that the health risk of e-cigarett are small in comparison , but we still have to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what not , especi when there is so much public confus about the relat risk compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl die each year from a diseas relat to smoke , and smoke cost the health servic £2 billion per year .
the clear proof of current evid that e-cigarett are not without risk , but onli a fraction of the damag that is caus by smoke , are we fulfil our nation jurisdict .

eight golden rule for life in student resid hall
eleven year ago i move and even forgotten 19-year-old into student hous , still in the faith of beret and moral relativ , but onli now i rememb the strain smile of those i ve annoy - and the numer , lengthi complaint about other .
most of what i have learn , can be distil into eight simpl rule .
in the student resid rang from slight nerve-wrack up to absolut terrifi .
it is tempt to chat about : peopl , where you are come from , and where you ve taken sabbat , where you stand in relat to corbyn and whi you marmit `` frank neither love nor hate , becaus serious guy , it 's onli a yeast extract hahaha , i 'm in my room .
you breath through .
and help other to do the same - ask question and show interest .
it steer the convers and help you to find the peopl you would like as oppos to those with whom you do not speak , even if your eyelash were caught on fire and the fire extinguish .
let peopl .
the room of peopl turn into drink-recept , movie-night venu and local venu , but they are also the place where peopl dress up and her underwear back .
relat to this : you do n't start think about at the univers with a relationship
introvert get a rough treatment at the univers .
your bedroom should be a haven , but mani student resid form a room-to-room-stroll-cultur that is friend and social and can lead to life-long friendship .
it can be hell for someon who is tri to recov .
noth in the cultur that allow you to say , `` i love you , and i want our friendship to go on , but you have to leav so that i get back the energi that i use for the interact with you . ''
tri to feel when the marshal is weari of sociabl - and you will send an sms knock him .
speak of knock on the door : do it .
a guy in my student resid hall had the idea that a lock door was not an invit .
he saw some thing .
close friendship by bake .
sinc the univers at the height of the back-mania , is the knock on the door of peopl with a plate of browni , less strang than the greet of the 1950 's `` welcom to the neighborhood , i ve bake you someth . and now , pleas smile when i ask you a few person question . ''
homemad offer is a good way to strike up new friendship .
her housem feel oblig to talk and perhap eventu will associ your face with a tasti morsel .
of cours , this depend on whether you are a decent baker .
bad mix clump of flour , sugar and fat caus peopl are sleep , if you knock on the door .

check with the dairi owner .
the chanc are good that they say to themselv , even if they cook insid .
if someon steal your stuff , it is annoy , and you have my sympathi - but tri to deal with it more balanc than my resid who ad their milk a deterg to punish thiev .
she is now in prison .
you should not make nois , dissuad peopl from sleep or at work .
it is not just a matter of be a decent human be , but that you are in the truest sens of the proverb about the peopl who sit in the glass hous .
a girl in my hall ask her neighbour to ask whether it make them someth a littl quieter drum & bass , becaus it 's three o'clock in the morn , and she had a test in the morn .
they respond with even more loud music .
when they final stop at 5 p.m. , they let their neighbour kind sleep two hour befor they had their own music blare , their door graduat and embark on their three-hour exam .
would it not be romant , if your futur spous would random collect in the same student hous ?
convers , it would be deepli embarrass if you keep your futur as a resid assist , a special featur to separ them , and then they have to see everi day , and mayb see how it move across all common friend ?
of cours , the heart goe it own way , but if a resid assist is definit not your futur , tri at least to persuad your bodi a littl common sens .
leav in the excit moment when you notic that someon has not verschlossenem his key in his room , the line between have fun appeal and bulli is finer than it seem .

at their most anticip meet in year fed strategist spend two day this week around a 27-foot honduran-mahogani tabl , to decid whether it is time , for the first time in almost a decad to rais the feder fund rate .
loom over them at one end of the ornat , two-stori meet hall there is a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that the fed chair janet l. yellen and her colleagu on the econom interest of the nation abov all other thing to do .
the central bank has a dual mandat from congress : the us employ and keep price stabl here .
but sinc the great recess , the fed leader have acknowledg that there is an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and this third mandat could be the x-factor in a decis , which is too close to predict , it will be announc on thursday that the us economi is readi to start , from the unpreced stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate sinc the end of 2008 to be wean .
although most of the econom data show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market alreadi cautious fed offici are fear that this volatil by increas the interest rate for bund to increas - if onli by a quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious , the labour market and inflat will be first and foremost the most import thing they '' observ , lindsey m. piegza , chefökonomin at brokerag stifel nicolaus & co. , said
`` but i think if they were look for a pretext to increas the interest rate is not the increas uncertainti is to wait around the global market enough justif to continu , '' she said .
there is no consensus on what the fed will do what insecur themselv in the financi market .
about half of the economist who were recent survey by bloomberg , have forecast a rate hike this week .
the financi market expect a wait of the fed , with a key indic , show onli a 30 % chanc of an increas .
this suggest a declin in the stock market if the fed rais rate , unless the strategist soften the blow by promis that a further increas is far away .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump by 228,89 point , or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
the action was trigger by expect that the fed 's polici maintain the sentenc this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
it would be a surpris if the fed rais rate at this time would be , `` he said .
if it doe , `` they would have to go veri far in it statement to calm the financi market , so that they do not end up in panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate hike would reassur the financi market , becaus it would elimin the uncertainti about when the fed will act .
even a month ago , the fed seem well on the way to increas the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would test the strength of the recoveri in the unit state .
yellen had in the spring and earli summer said that this year , despit the complaint from liber that more econom progress would requir an increas in the rate expect .
although job creation slow in august , the improv in the labor market has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year , and close to the level that the fed consid full employ .
wage increas have shown sign of recoveri .
and although inflat is below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the fed offici said that the main reason for the temporari impact of sharpli lower oil price .
`` the economi can cope with higher interest rate and need them becaus of the strain on the labour market , '' ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom said .
but the financi market around the world togeth zuckten late last month , after china had devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag fell in may by more than 16 % below it all-tim high , as investor fear that a slowdown in the chines economi would slow global growth .
the market has recov somewhat this month , while the dow is now down by almost 10 % lower than in may .
the fed repres influenc the market turbul , the complex calcul of when to rais interest rate .
`` if the event in the financi market and the news about the weak of the chines economi over the past few week had not occur , they would attract the rein in this session , '' said stephen d. olin , senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former employe of the us feder reserv .
now he predict that it will wait at least a month to get a better handl on the impact .
`` there is a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the us economi will be , and there is almost no reliabl data that describ the develop in china , '' said olin .
the health of the global economi is not the main concern of the fed , so technic they should not be involv in their decision-mak .
but in the end , the fed has becom monetari author in the world .
the influenc of the central bank was enorm in recent year .
the mere hint of then-lead ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed 's monetari expans could `` narrow '' trigger confus around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , repres from the fed can be expect to not onli monitor the develop elsewher , but also with other central bank and expert advis to get a better understand of the global economi .
their decision-mak is `` more art than scienc , '' zachari kara bell , head of global strategi , said the asset manag firm envestnet inc .

the arsenal captain mikel arteta say that teammat befor the game against dynamo zagreb behind the injur jack must be goal.com
wenger told goal.com stress that it was onli septemb , and if his rehabilit goe accord to plan , there is no reason whi he ca n't play again befor christma .
this optimist scenario mean that goal.com will certain miss at least the next four game for england and given his histori , his particip in next summer 's european championship will still uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that the goal.com had finish last season strong after a separ ankl injuri and then was back to his old swing found dure the earli season .
this kind of `` threat of injuri is not the career , '' wenger said .
it is a bone that has not heal well .
this is not a major issu .
this was just an accid .
it was not link to his ankl , or with the injuri he had befor .
that may be true from a pure medic point of view , but also , as wenger acknowledg , there is the risk of further injuri , whenev a player tri to return in the middl of the season .
it also develop an unpleas pattern .
the investig of premier injuri ltd 23 differ diseas from goal.com record sinc his debut six year ago .
he also play in just 65 of arsenal 157 leagu game in the last five season .
the broader pictur for arsenal is that they were in six of eight season sinc 2007 / 08 , one of the two premier leagu club , who have had the most injuri .
wenger accept the potenti of a vicious circl , but arsenal believ that an improv in the injuri rate will continu dure the last season .
`` sometim when you come back from an injuri , you have a vulner period , a time in which you need to strengthen your bodi and gain power struggl , '' said wenger .
jack is young enough to overcom that .
i hope his bodi stabil , i am confid that he will do it and go through a career of the sort that he deserv .
arsenal begin it champion leagu season against dinamo zagreb on wednesday even befor the game against chelsea on saturday and against tottenham hotspur on wednesday , and wenger is a rotat within the team .
héctor bellerín and aaron ramsey have not travel to croatia , which mean that mathieu debuchi and arteta are like to start .
wenger can also start with kieran gibb and olivi giroud instead of nacho monreal and theo walcott .
`` i tri to keep the balanc and the player who need to get a littl breather , '' wenger said .
although arsenal are clear favourit to progress from group f , the maksimir stadium in zagreb is one of the playground with the greatest intimid effect in europ .
dynamo is unrival , even after 41 game after the `` invinc '' campaign was launch in the last season .
the stadium was rock by an earthquak on tuesday even , with 3.2 were measur on the richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in zagreb .
wenger believ that arsenal , the lesson from the last season with the champion leagu defeat against monaco has taken and will continu to be driven by the distant hope , with his manag of the club to it first uefa champion leagu triumph .
`` this drive is immens , '' wenger said .
it has never work at arsenal .
in 2006 , we were veri close , but on the other hand , i am long enough in the busi to be realist .
we are ambiti , but we are not dreamer .
friend : the comedi show that serious lesson about male friendship grant
the lack of similar imag in the show is obvious , particular with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desper than ever , as suicid rate among young men on a 15-year high .
in 2013 , it was the main caus of death in men age 20 to 45 in the uk , and it is three time more common in men than in women .
in a bid to tackl the problem , the campaign against live miser ( calm - campaign announc against a pathet life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to challeng the cultur in question , the men to seek help when they need it .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challeng .
a recent studi of more than 2,000 high school student with depress symptom note that if the suffer a suffici high percentag of friend with `` healthi '' mood , had doubl his chanc of recoveri are .
for those who are not depress , cut a circl of mental healthi friend the risk of mental problem .
but , of cours , you have to have friend , a friendship can work .
in the age of social media-l communic , with it emphasi on style over substanc , the immediaci of the respons is often more import than a meaning contact .
our digit live are live , strong , and to be success , doubl , even if , in fact , domin the isol .
this superfici success is domin by what psychologist call extrins valu ; money , reput , social status , all at the expens of intrins valu - our inner desir for person develop and friendship , which affect our mental health is much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billionair recent declar that money realli ca n't buy happi .
the beauti of friend was that this focus has been turn upsid down .
each charact has been defin by his work , but becaus of his person , which was notabl for the interact as a friend .
the humor of joey and chandler frequent hug , moment when footbal peer into comfort armchair and the long of ross , rachel , all of which came from the knowledg that men can refer to it in ani case , even if they are often reluct to fulli explor their feel .
as an employe of the telecommun ministri told me : ... `` my audienc role for peopl who are feel depress and at risk of suicid , has realli shown me how even the smallest interact of friend can make a differ . ''
the men who contact us , often feel unabl to talk with friend .
the old say `` i get it '' has a huge impact , as the feel that it is perceiv as a weak when you talk about issu openly. ``
friend of one of the show that come to my mind is when i tri to offer longer-term cope mechan .
you clear present the small moment of male friendship .
so my object outsid status over the phone to peopl in moment of despair , may also contribut to the long-term support come from a person network of famili and friend .
and so if you visit this weekend , comedi central friend decid to celebr the day with the complet redesign backdrop , whi do n't you take your friend for a drink at the central perk .
or , even better , if you are sit around in starbuck alon someon see you give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what differ could make your friendship .
