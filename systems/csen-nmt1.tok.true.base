8 elect figur show donald trump in real light
some tri to identifi him as a man who often chang his mind .
the rest of them wave a hand like an unbeaten joke .
and some prepar for implos .
but whether some republican are tri to pull donald trump down from the top of the elect , they re not do it ( yet ) .
10 of the last 11 nation survey show that donald trump is in the lead on a double-digit number , and some peopl are start to serious ask what that mean for the nomin chanc of this magnat in the area of real estat .
of cours , it is onli the begin of the elect cycl .
none of this say trump is like to win the republican nomin .
expert point out that , at this time of 2011 , the lead of rick perri 's path to the rise of herman cain , ultim neither of them won the onli posit in the nomin process .
there are mani reason whi he might run into general elect .
but outsid group such as the super pac jeb bush and the econom conserv group club for growth are awar of trump 's will to endur and begin to interpret their dollar at a halt with the aim of toppl him .
here are some recent poll number suggest that the real-est tycoon is not just a fleet phase :
trump 's assess of the posit has turn 180 degre .
just befor donald trump announc his candidaci in mid-jun , it show a vote by monmouth univers that onli two out of 10 republican have a posit look at this real estat magnat .
by mid-juli , that was 40 percent .
at the start of august , it was 52 percent .
now , six of the 10 republican have a favor view of donald trump .
around three out of 10 say they have a negat opinion on him .
and these number are held in the earli stage .
after vote for the univers of quinnipiac , which pass last week , it found that 60 percent of republican had a posit opinion on trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as a candid .
in a cnn / orc poll conduct last week , 67 percent of republican said they would be either `` excit '' or `` satisfi '' with trump as a candid .
onli two of 10 said they would be `` indign '' from his candidaci .
onli ben carson produc rough the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent of peopl said they would be `` thrill '' against the 40 per cent who say the same about trump ) .
anoth closest at the level of enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with onli 21 per cent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republican voter say they would be `` dissatisfi '' or `` distraught '' if the favourit of jeb bush becam a candid .
most republican do n't see trump 's tempera as a problem .
while donald trump has been wide critic for his nasti and insult , 52 percent of republican voter are nationwid inclin to think that the real estat has the magnat 's right tempera for the presid , accord to monday 's abc news / washington post .
the same number is held in the state 's iowa state club , which is the first in the countri , where 52 percent of republican think it has the person of the command , accord to quinnipiac from last week .
still , 44 percent think he doe n't have the person to serv effect , and near 6 out of 10 independ say his tempera doe n't belong to the white hous , accord to abc / post .
republican voter are get use to the idea .
when he put on his savvi hat , republican voter think trump is a real candid .
on the question of who is most like to win the gop nomin , four out of 10 said trump would be the best option , accord to a cnn / orc poll from last week .
that 's a chang from late juli , when four out of 10 were bet their money on jeb bush .
full disclosur : the gop voter have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
by this time in the past cycl , 4 out of 10 republican chose rick perri as an award-win candid against 28 percent for mitt romney 's eventu nomin .
yet it turn out that a certain number of gop voter see the trump campaign as credibl .
even if republican have gather around anoth candid , trump equal defeat almost everyon .
some pundit emphas that the fragment field is like to contribut to trump 's leadership , while anti-trump support is diffus between more than a dozen other candid .
but a monmouth univers survey from the start of septemb show that in a hypothet direct contest between trump and most of the other republican candid , trump will receiv almost alway major support .
he lead abov car fiorina by 13 point , marc rubio by 14 point , walker by 15 point , jeb bush by 19 point , and final rand paul , john kasich , chris christi by 33 point at each .
he 's in a dead race with ted cruz .
the onli candid who defeat him ?
ben carson would lead over the businessman on a wide 19 point in a hypothet game of one against one .
the bare major of donald trump 's follow claim that they have alreadi made their point .
a new tuesday 's cbs / nyt poll show that onli more than half of voter support trump claim they wo n't chang their mind .
it 's obvious that a lot of thing can chang , and no one can realli say that he would never chang his mind .
46 percent say they keep an open backdoor for chang between candid .
yet trump is the current strongest oppon of his outsid 's fellow neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who consid their opinion final would go twice more like to vote for trump .
6 out of 10 republican report agre with trump on immigr issu .
inde , ever sinc donald trump call immigr from mexico `` thug '' in the announc speech of his campaign , immigr still stand as the main and central topic of the 2016 convers .
some worri that trump 's drudgeri will lure key hispan voter away from the republican parti and damag to rebrand .
but accord to a new monday poll by abc / post , six out of 10 republican claim to agre with trump on immigr issu .
as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , donald trump will remain as well .
frustrat at the govern is reach new high .
donald trump and ben carson now receiv rough half of the support from republican voter , especi given their status as outsid .
six of the 10 republican in the new monday 's abc / post poll say they want a polit outsid rather than someon with govern experi .
and they are also veri angri at washington .
a vote by the des moin regist / bloomberg in iowa a few week ago reveal that three of the four republican in iowa are frustrat by republican in congress , 54 percent are `` dissatisfi '' and 21 percent `` hellish angri . ''

the czech republ will acquir more than 400 million .
the hous of common at first read support the govern 's amend to the top bill , which regul the amount of revenu from the surfac mine of brown coal from mine compani .
minist john mousdek ( čssd ) has promis mps that it will rais money in addit to both the treasuri and the budget of the municip .
the draft has been criticis by mps who worri that mine compani will no longer want to sponsor the communiti as yet , becaus they will pay higher fee direct to the state budget . the hous in first read has support the govern 's new top law , which in addit to other mean that the state should receiv a greater share of the proceed of the levi on the surfac mine of brown coal from mine compani .
the state 's share will rise to 67 per cent , while the municip 's share will be reduc from the current 75 per cent to 33 per cent .
the draft is also chang the way to calcul reimburs for the miner that compani extract .
the chang in fee for mine oper is to bring to the treasuri about $ 427 million more than in 2013 .
the govern 's revenu budget are to have a neutral impact , accord to the govern , becaus the fee is to be higher .
in the previous year , commut receiv from fee of about $ 450 million and a state budget of $ 150 million .
from the extract of brown coal , there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor .
the amend also envisag an increas in the amount of recoveri in excess of eur 1000 per hectar per hectar per year .
the incom from these remitt remain in it entireti .
industri minist john mousdek ( čssd ) told mps that commut would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor .
the amount of mine fee will no longer be determin by the law , but it is set by the govern by it regul .
the payment shall be recalcul as a product of the amount of the miner extract and the rate for the differ type of miner .
accord to the govern , the reason for the chang is that of a flexibl respons to the current econom situat .
howev , mep mark benda warn that the price of the levi by the govern doe not need to be in line with the constitut .
but , accord to secretari of youth , it is not a tax in this case , becaus the state is charg a nerv that is state-own .
the fee are receiv onli by municip whose territori are affect .
in the case of deep-sea coal mine , there will be three-quart of the communiti 's money and a quarter of the state .
the same ratio will be in the case of radioact rock extract .
part of the money that the state will collect on mine fee will be assign .
for exampl , 28 percent will have to go to repair the damag after mine or to provid a year-long rescu servic .
the draft was criticis by opposit mps , who argu in particular that it would hurt communiti affect by mine and the region .
for exampl , michal kucera ( top 09 and mayor ) warn that mine compani would no longer want to sponsor the communiti as yet , becaus they would pay higher fee direct to the state budget .

prior to the increas in unemploy at mosteck , mrs ksčm warn hana aulicka .
kádner and aulicki have fail to dismiss the amend , and he want the law to return the govern to finish .
in the explanatori memorandum , it say that , accord to mine compani , the increas in fee is not reflect in coal price , becaus price are from more than 90 per cent in the long term .
thus , major consum like power plant or theater should not feel price growth .
`` on the other hand , this realli increas the risk that the mine organis will offset the increas in reimburs by tri to reduc their oper cost , which in particular would reduc the number of employe , '' the govern admit .
howev , the increas in fee in term of employ is manag .
accord to the rapporteur , the amend to milan urbana ( čssd ) is crucial that mps have yet to know the conclus about the updat energi concept and , abov all , the govern 's decis on the limit of coal mine .
if coal is also benefit from the limit , then it will have implic for yield for both the state and the communiti , he point out .
urban disagre with the youngster in that the decis to break the limit at the bottom of the czechoslovak armi should fail until after 2020 .
the limit on csa below should be broken for reason of social , econom , and , becaus of the long-term stabil of domest energi .

sinc cbs news last month , clinton has lost ground on sever demograph group while sander has gain sever .
clinton keep a big head start between women and moder , but her leadership is narrow .
her support among men has fallen signific , and sander is lose onli 5 point .
clinton 's advantag with democrat voter under 50 year has evapor , and now sander is equal .
but clinton still has a big lead becaus of older voter .
last month , clinton had a double-digit lead in front of sander among the liber , but now sander is lose onli 5 point in this group .

biden of all three lead in honesti while clinton is a strong leader .
thirti percent of democrat primari voter do n't think clinton is honest and trustworthi , then twice as much as those who say the same about sander ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do n't have that view .

half of american are now unhappi with her explan , while onli about a third are satisfi .
the public 's view on the subject were split in march , short after that problem emerg .
most american claim that this email controversi has no bear on their overal view of clinton , while at 36 percent , their opinion on clinton has deterior .
it 's most republican , where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion on clinton has worsen .
even though clinton is seen as honest and trustworthi among the voter of her parti , the issu is still a problem among regist voter overal : onli 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthi , a drop of eight point from last month , and 15 point from may .
sixty-two percent of regist voter do n't think she 's honest and trustworthi .
and at the same time , 55 percent of regist voter across the countri also do n't see trump as honest and trustworthi .
but both clinton and trump have good mark for leadership .
of the six test candid , biden , carson and bush were best place in honesti .
sander see more peopl as honest than dishonest , but , as with carson , a lot of voter have not made an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sampl of 351 primari democrat voter is 6 percentag point .

this with the tent when the fed rais interest rate
growth rate will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will rise , and the economi will slip into recess .
we know all this .
what we do n't know is how much time it take and how long it will take .
for the economi , it specif offer the histori of the littl origin about the time .
the recess came after 11 month after the first rate rise and last 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , decis in how the economi and financi asset react .
this is whi us central bank offici stress so strong that investor should not be confus about when the rate hike will begin , but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are inde more variabl in the game .
howev , in the end , the member of the market can make sure that all the fuss becaus of an increas in speed can be exagger .
`` the fed 's first increas sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be some interpret as the end of an era of cheap money , ' '' he said in a note to client julian jessop , lead global economist at capit econom .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rate to be more common but still low , creat a seismic shock that mani might fear .
that mean there will be advers effect .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi will respond , base on histor trend :
given what the market has seen in the past around a month , the expect rate hike may make the air a littl volatil .
but , onc the increas occur , the effect will not be so dramat .
`` there seem to be a trend to recap stock after 12-24 month after the first increas , which again may reflect a lag in monetari polici , '' said analyst at deutsch bank in a recent studi on what will happen after the fed hike .
in fact , the market for the last rough 35 year is often the most - about 14 per cent - head into a rate rise in relat flat in 250 day ( averag gain of 2.6 per cent ) , and then return to normal after 500 day , with the averag yield of 14.4 per cent from the last six cycl , accord to a recent analysi of bob dolla , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , publish on barron .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to becom more pronounc later in the rate hike cycl , and the return is begin to decreas .
recess is a fact of econom life , but rais rate often help .
current , the fed face some condit that have not yet exist , and which could precipit recess .
most notabl is that gross domest product close to it lowest point in histori in rais the fed rate .
accord to deutsch bank , dure the 118 rate increas sinc 1950 , onli twice the nomin annual increas in gdp was below 4.5 per cent .
even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015 , few expect it retent when it was at just 1.5 per cent in the third quarter , the atlanta fed say .
rais rate in this complex econom background could be riski and could discov the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip were readi to grow the fed for a year and all eye turn to a meet of the feder open market committe , which was held this week and end on thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ that the fomc could approv an increas at this meet , futur trade indic onli a 25 per cent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all of the increas cycl so far have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp cover the peak of the begin of the recess veri quick after the count recoveri , '' it write in the report .
on the contrari , this was clear a slow recoveri from the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest of those that the fed has expect sinc the end of the last recess ; the record has been 35 month , we are now at 74 month and still continu .
the fix yield was also volatil as the market expect an increas in rate , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experienc .
the key differ is that the impact is more rapid on bond than in stock when the fed chang the direct of polici .
for bond , yield appear to chang direct immedi after the first arriv of the increas / reduct cycl .
at the end of the cycl of increas bond yield , they fall immedi , `` deutsch said .
the strategist of charl schwab believ that an increas in rate will caus return between long- and short-dat bond , equal to a curv .
high-yield bond often work better in this climat , though `` we are still cautious about strain the yield , '' kathi jone , a fixed-incom analyst at schwab , said in her analysi .
interest , jone think the market are alreadi adjust to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength of the dollar and the declin in inflat expect , there are few sign that the market has adjust to the outlook for tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flat , the credit margin has widen , and volatil has increas - all market characterist when the fed tighten polici .
general speak , compani that carri out most of their busi in the us will win interest rate after rais interest rate , and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt are go to get wors as the rise dollar will make their product more expens in the world market and their debt will also be larger .
`` histori show that the '' qualiti `` of share tend to be overcom over the cours of three month after the initi rate increas , '' analyst at goldman sach said in a report for client .
compani with strong balanc sheet were overtaken by weak balance-sheet compani in everi interest-r hike in 1994 , 1999 , 2004 , on averag , by 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit , as well as stock with low volatil , also outperform their lower-qu counterpart on averag by 4 ( percentag point ) , or 3 ( percentag point ) .
debt becom a big problem .
compani with a high percentag of move interest rate will lose the most , goldman said .
outsid of pure stock game , consum also benefit from the rise dollar .
saver can see their profit also through higher return , but expert have differ view on how long it will take .

when the control run his finger along a line of rivet , he ll know if ani of them are out of toler .
then he ll take the exact condition to the hand .
letov had a program of an l-39 train militari aircraft prior to 1989 .
but in 1991 , neither did one .
the compani had to find new contract quick .
it was then put togeth with the european aircraft manufactur airbus .
she won a select process for an emerg door supplier for the a321 .
the courtship with boe was not that happi .
`` we were a small firm for them at the time , which did n't have enough money for invest and for boe to guarante long-term stabl deliveri , '' dubski recal .
the door to the american manufactur would remain close if letov did not attend the french group latecoer 's pragu intern associ in 1999 .
i was talk about our co-oper with airbus .
the next day , negoti were underway with the french , say dubský .
a year later , latecoer had bought the czech compani and with a strong compani came new contract .
in 2000 , the assembl of part of the door for the a320 was start .
three year later , the door of the upper deck for the a380 were ad .
in 2006 , the compani built a new hall for process composit for deliveri for the boe dreamlin .
without latecoer , we would n't be abl to get to these great contract .
mayb we would do part or small part .
partner want to guarante suppli for twenti or thirti year , dubský explain .
last year , czech latecoer achiev a turnov of over $ 2.9 billion and profit after tax of $ 147 million .
exclus status among supplier of aircraft manufactur is not free .
latecoer has invest £1.5 billion in pragu sinc 2000 .
the compani must have certif of qualiti , certif of 170 specif product process and qualif for key staff .
without them , the compani would not make ani door to the aircraft .
obtain certif that product process conform to custom `` demand , and in repeat check , keep them on hold accord to dubai million of kronor .
product process chang everi year .
they are more accur and stricter .
we have to train staff , retrofit the facil and re-certifi the process , add dubský .
now the compani is complet the prepar of a process for coat zinc and nickel to replac the past for human health harm cadmium .
they receiv the award from the manufactur , but then they had to adapt the technolog to the equip or chemic they use in pragu .
boe peopl arriv , check the concept of the whole line .
then we show them the product .
they ll check our lab .
one set of sampl will test themselv in their laboratori and then compar the result with our , close the dubai way that the custom control them .
the reward is the pragu firm 's long-term exclus contract .
with the pragu race today , the product of the red is fall .
for the a320 , it produc half of the total volum of the door .
replac the czech latecoer is either imposs or veri complex for a brazilian or european produc .
but it doe not mean that he could tell ani price at the door .
part of the contract is the price curv .
it show how much one door will cost after ten , fifti , hundred-mad piec .
the price is still fall to some limit valu .
we must enter this price pattern .
if not , we will lose , say dubski .
half the hall , where the electr cabinet for the airbus a400 m militari aircraft are complet , is yet empti .
but he is the symbol of the futur .
behind the apron , there is a new semi-robot line on rivet and fit the door for an upgrad model of a320 neo .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
`` that 's the trend that assembl in aviat is go to take , '' add dubský .
the futur line is secur .
airbus report that airlin have so far order 3278 piec of the new a320 model .
just a few metr away , there will be a line for the complet assembl of door for the top deck of the a380 .
it 's a strateg decis by our parent compani .
the aim is to reduc product time and reduc cost .
full assembl could begin within two year , say dubai .
but befor that , the compani must pass a qualif test for the assembl of some electr and electron devic to the door for the largest airbus .
the compani is also bet on further develop of composit materi .
in addit to boe , it should also particip in the new airbus a350 , which will compet with the us dreamlin .
`` it 's a huge credit for the compani , when it can process even composit in addit to metal materi , '' dubský say proud .
howev , latecoer is at the edg of product capac in the czech republ .
in the area of letov , where he is base , there is no next place .
befor join the french mother , the compani had 180 employe .
now it has 800 , and within three year there could be a hundr more .
as long as airbus and boe are forecast how mani hundr of new aircraft the airlin are order each year , they may not be worri about the job .
although it has contract for sever year ahead , it has face the parent compani of the pragu latecoer threat of bankruptci .
the french group did not have enough money for the septemb loan repay .
in the end , latecoer was abl to communic with the main creditor .
at the end of august , some of the loan trade them for share .
the lender have gain 37.4 per cent in the compani by increas the capit by 57.4 million euro .
the compani 's debt fell by two-third , or €180 million .
the second part of the financi recoveri came at the begin of septemb .
the compani wrote a new stock of €222.9 million among the exist sharehold .
in total , it rais the capit of €280 million .
in do so , the whole group is benefit from the grow product of airbus and boe , who are involv in sale of 85 per cent .
averag growth in contract is expect to rise by four per cent a year until 2017 .
in a contract book , it has order for 2.6 billion euro , equival to four-year product .
french media claim that latecoer is final abl to breath again after year on the drip .
the czech republ race in pragu airlin is signific for the group .
the group 's sale contribut 16 per cent .
accord to the number of employe , the group 's largest foreign affili .
mps support a greater share of the state from the levi on coal .
the chang in fee for mine oper is to bring to the treasuri about $ 427 million more than in 2013 .
the govern 's revenu budget are to have a neutral impact , accord to the govern , becaus the fee is to be higher .
in the previous year , commut receiv from fee of about $ 450 million and a state budget of $ 150 million .
from the extract of brown coal , there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor .
the amend also envisag an increas in the amount of recoveri in excess of czk 1,000 per hectar per hectar per year .
the incom from these remitt remain in it entireti .
industri minist john mousdek ( čssd ) told mps that commut would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor .
the amount of mine fee will no longer be determin by the law , but it is set by the govern by it regul .
the payment shall be recalcul as a product of the amount of the miner extract and the rate for the differ type of miner .
accord to the govern , the reason for the chang is that of a flexibl respons to the current econom situat .
howev , mep mark benda warn that the price of the levi by the govern doe not need to be in line with the constitut .
but , accord to secretari of youth , it is not a tax in this case , becaus the state is charg a nerv that is state-own .
the fee are receiv onli by municip whose territori are affect .
in the case of deep-sea coal mine , there will be three-quart of the communiti 's money and a quarter of the state .
the same ratio will be in the case of radioact rock extract .
part of the money that the state will collect on mine fee will be assign .
for exampl , 28 percent will have to go to repair the damag after mine or to provid a year-long rescu servic .
the draft was criticis today by opposit mps , who argu in particular that it would hurt communiti affect by mine and the region .
for exampl , michal kucera ( top 09 and mayor ) warn that mine compani would no longer want to sponsor the communiti as yet , becaus they would pay higher fee direct to the state budget .
`` it 's not possibl to tunnel one of the poorest region just to make the minist of financ improv the budget , '' said david kádner ( dawn ) elect in the ústí region .
prior to the increas in unemploy at mosteck , mrs ksčm warn hana aulicka .
kádner and aulicki have fail to dismiss the amend , and he want the law to return the govern to finish .
in the explanatori memorandum , it say that , accord to mine compani , the increas in fee is not reflect in coal price , becaus price are from more than 90 per cent in the long term .
thus , major consum like power plant or theater should not feel price growth .
`` on the other hand , this realli increas the risk that the mine organis will offset the increas in reimburs by tri to reduc their oper cost , which in particular would reduc the number of employe , '' the govern admit .
howev , the increas in fee in term of employ is manag .
accord to the rapporteur , the amend to milan urbana ( čssd ) is crucial that mps have yet to know the conclus about the updat energi concept and , abov all , the govern 's decis on the limit of coal mine .
if coal is also benefit from the limit , then it will have implic for yield for both the state and the communiti , he point out .
urban disagre with the youngster in that the decis to break the limit at the bottom of the czechoslovak armi should fail until after 2020 .
the limit on csa below should be broken for reason of social , econom , and , becaus of the long-term stabil of domest energi .

sure david cameron know the lorax better ?
everi parent know this thing : when a child fall in love with a book , it doe n't take long to learn it almost memori .
you must not be david cameron .
on the inquiri of children 's scheme to appoint a favourit children 's book , prime minist lorax , a byte sinc dr seuss , was chosen from 1971 .
it was hard to pick , write cameron in a report publish on supercamp websit and continu : `` funni , pathet , creativ and with strong content , i like to read such to my children becaus there was alway an imag or messag that i had n't seen befor . ''
all right , after that , in the follow paragraph , cameron report describ the plot of the book by an elev from the 2012 film that ad more charact and detail to fill out a brief origin text .
`` in the citi of thneed-vill surround by wall , where all natur has ceas to exist , and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of a girl of his dream , audrey , by fulfil her wish to see the real tree , '' is the brief content of a book that record the object of love unknown to dr seuss , whose real name was theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
as though it was n't suspici enough , the text deliv by cameron read like a summari lift of the lorax film , which is locat on the internet movi databas , and begin with the word , `` in the citi of thneed-vill walled-in , where all natur has ceas to exist , and even the air is a commod , a boy call ted hope to win the heart of a girl of your dream , audrey . ''
becaus he was an open practic parent , it seem unlik that cameron would not have met the children of the book , where the unnam young man would know the local natur of the devast , the tree fell by industrialist once-l , who , despit the protest of the titular lorax , a crouch , moustachio creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like , the relat minor pr task was given to an assist who had never read lorax 's child 20 time in a row .
a down street spokeswoman said the text was like to come from the offic of support of cameron .
supercamp confirm that the text was provid by an employe of cameron , but without further comment .
adam lyth was at risk of the omiss of england but still hold
compet with pakistan in the unit arab emir is a difficult task , but after watch the team that england chose on this tour , it will be a repeat of the defeat of the 3-0 that she suffer last time in the test seri , not veri like .
i would n't rule out win guest either .
the side of alastair cooper may be less experienc than that three year ago , but there are good player sleep in this bat line-up and also the collect think is strong ; they do n't bear the scar of 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali emerg spinner and adil rashid , even if he is unknown at the test seri , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop out of the england team in the tri seri and was replac by alex hale .
the decis to dismiss adam lyth is a tough one for me to analys becaus his main coach is in yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and simpl , but the hard realiti is that cricket player are judg on the basi of perform .
for exampl , around the name joe root there were no question mark , which led to the announc becaus - and i ve put this befor - the player are their best selector .
a few more half-centuri , and lyth could extend his seri , but he had control of his own destini .
hope if he can get more run for yorkshir , there will be anoth opportun .
england 's chief coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud , although his perform were not entir 100 per cent , and i am not surpris by that ; he was alway a team player .
the question of how much test time will get the batsman to show up is a tough nut .
lyth got seven cap - as did sam robson befor him - while nick compton won nine .
onli compton got a chanc at home and out .
the onli thing that you could gripe about is that england gave first chanc to jonathan trott in the caribbean - although he was lyth in the best form - but this wast opportun is past .
here come alex hale and that 's the batsman i valu veri posit .
it 's the x-factor cricket player we ve seen here in yorkshir at the start of the season , when he won the 236 on trent bridg , which he did a littl bit .
he must be given at least the same opportun given by his predecessor , but this will depend , of cours , on the general assembl in the unit arab emir .
the idea when moeen start alongsid cook , who would gain anoth extra spinner while retain four quick , has been gift and i have no reserv against her .
i do n't understand whi the strokeak ca n't launch and this left-hand man has alreadi shown he 's an amaz player of cricket .
moeen may not be abl to do his job for his countri , worcestershir , but he was number 3 for them , and the big differ is not .
my former team-mat justin langer play first of his first 38 exam befor his appear in 2001 .
three centuri went by , and he did n't look back .
the team come by zafar ansari as a backup spinner and when i had the chanc to watch him , he took me as a veri impress young man .
peopl can look at it gross statist - an averag of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and i see it as a pram , but there are n't a lot of spinner who would rais their hand , and selector opt for youth .
he ll learn a lot about this tour .
outsid the team , england seem to have made some chang and a clever addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawardenea , a batsman from sri lanka , as a consult for trial match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the most beauti play men who will bring rich experi by have experi with all the condit and all the attack .
paul collingwood come in part of a tour of the white-bal and will bring in a team of both energi and ruthless spark .
i have alway felt that he was direct born into the world of intern cricket , whether as a player or coach , and as much as mahela possess the intellect that can be use .
new voic in the dress room , though it 's the voic of say consist thing that have been dealt with befor , can sometim lighten and refresh the atmospher .
collingwood 's teammat ben stoke was given a one-day leav , just as root got a similar break against australia and i have no problem with that decis .
even if mani disagre , coach and selector do not creat a timet .
and you have to rememb , as player , that their work depend on the result .
such decis can never be taken light .
a brexit campaign could win if the economi start to stagnat by 2017 .
david cameron 's ill-conceiv strategi for keep britain in the eu is get into other problem with everi pass day even without the elect of a brilliant jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbi to the head of the labor parti , or the tuc will take the whole situat around europ on tuesday .
foreign also have their corbyn and nigel farages .
a close friend of the european diplomat has recent explain how europ is mire in various crise - not all of them becaus of them - some member state alreadi have enough of the british egocentr agenda , divid concess , and disrupt chang to the treati , which they most did not want .
at their annual meet in brighton , the tuc decid they did n't want it even if they had denounc social protect .
we can even call it the selfi agenda of dave and georg .
the prime minist and chancellor go to summit or bilater meet in foreign capit , make a pictur befor a famous local monument , with or without local dignitari , and then return home with the word that they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european friend , who want to be inund by britain in european europ - `` we do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that some shortsight minist and offici in some capit have reach a point where they do n't care about our departur .
angela merkel , a german cautious balanc chancellor , is an alli , but she has been in power for 10 year and want to leav her post befor it becom bad for her , as has been the case for too long a continu thatchera ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
frenchman françoi holland face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
his power is also declin .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern on the right , spain on the left .
it 's difficult to see how to break my leg in help the selfi briton who might be abl to invest their energi better to prevent scotland from leav the uk - someth they do n't want , becaus they have similar separatist tendenc .
so some of these minist can plan deliber unhelp remark of the snp 's style dure the campaign ahead of the 2017 referendum in great britain to expedit the brexit process , a friend say .
`` renegoti has solv the problem '' and `` britain has noth worthwhil from negoti . ''
european , to their own detriment , know how feroci fleet street can be , and how skeptic about the eu are the press oligarch , becaus they were not inspir by toni ben in 1975 , which support our entri in 1973 , in a 2-1 ratio .
they can vagu rememb the name of bori johnson , the saudi-back euro-opportunist who made his name as the brussels-bas correspond of `` eu rover '' at the start of the 1990s .
despit his vaniti , ed miliband knew his enemi .
they includ a mixtur of villain of unpaid tax , foreign hack phone and the pseudo non-oversea departur that own most of the big newspap .
in fact , toni blair thought the same thing about them , but he realiz that when you were in a cage with a white gorilla , you had to throw banana at her so she would n't put you to dinner , and then also tea .
in fact , miliband was more like blair than blair himself , by oppos cameron 's refere routin , sinc blair admit the principl of the repeal of the eu constitut , which was sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 , and won the card bounci .
the press never forgav him .
but dear jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back on monday at westminst - i told him that he should not be wast my time on me - it seem to be in danger of a renew strategi of boycott murdoch neil kinnock , which was a mistak then and now .
it may take some time , but it need to develop a coher strategi of engag media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr , whose chair at the bbc on sunday has left .
corbin 's offici attitud toward europ , i ll say nice , evolv .
he argu that he would like to remain in a reform european union .
well , most peopl out of the frenzi tendenc of ukip and the wild shore of tori 's littl englander can certain accept that .
the same said hilari `` bemm , but not benniit '' benn on radio and televis this week , when his inner scout could not be commit to admit that corbi 's appoint of abraz mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad decis .
it remind me of the 1970s , when his old father fought on tv about his loyalti , without go too far and lose his job .
hillari 's game was much more attract .
but to fight to remain `` in all circumst '' - ben 's phrase - it seem not to have been what mcdonnel said , even what jc had told colleagu and mps at their privat meet on monday night ,
whatev the background , the sensit imag that corbyn want to convey - rememb , he also touch me - the disciplin of the report remain import in the age of tv transmiss , and especi in the faith , the painstak paranoia and betray that social media is
it 's fair not to provid cameron 's free ticket to europ , which would allow him to regard the support of the labor parti in the referendum campaign for the obvious , as mcdonnel said .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnello and corbi 's basic rude about eu membership - in line with their bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among leftist dissid for whom the narciss of small differ in the central natur of dogmat bicker .
as with his crackdown on nato - tom watson is confid that the jc campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomat will be requir to tri to understand the mean of it all for their home master .
whi should pari or berlin spend polit capit - they also have suspici voter - becaus of the concess of britain when it seem unnecessari ?
the unit state is alreadi quit disappoint in the brisket `` weak militari perform in iraq , libya and syria , even in reduc the cost of the conserv govern in power , as i was remind of monday 's launch of what was call the secur forum of british influenc .

one in 12 particip admit fund from the manufactur of e-cigarett , but not the fund alleg obtain earlier from tobacco compani philip morri intern , they add .
the reason for select member of the panel is not avail , but they contain sever well-known champion of e-cigarett , some of whom also claim industri fund in the paper .
some of the other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in the fight against smoke .
a meet in phe also took part in the tobacco leadership .
the report creat in this group `` eloqu admit , '' the lack of `` hard evid of the damag of most product to most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or restrict is describ in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe claim that `` so far there is no evid that e-cigarett would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smok , '' was prematur .
professor kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had alreadi been answer befor .
he said : `` electron cigarett are consider less harm than smoke . ''
one of two lifelong smoker will die becaus of their addict .
all evid suggest that health risk pose by electron cigarett are small in comparison , but we need to continu to examin the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show , and also what they do n't show , especi when there was so much public confus about relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die from diseas relat to smoke and smoke cost the nhs £2 billion a year .
a clear highlight of the current evid - that even if e-cigarett are not without risk , bear onli a fraction of the damag caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation compet .
bbc should quit with eastend , say former director of channel 4
the former director of channel 4 , luke johnson , said the bbc should stop broadcast programm such as eastend and the voic , and confirm that it commerci rival would `` give the right hand '' for a hit show such as albert squar .
johnson said the licenc fee should onli be use for program not made by other british televis broadcast .
he criticis the bbc for put public servic program like to be watch by onli a hand of peopl , into complex broadcast time over it rival `` biggest rate show , and on channel such as bbc4 .
after general director toni hall said the corpor want to do more in partnership with other organis , johnson said he had unsuccess tri to connect with the bbc for the entir six year he work on channel 4 .
`` i struggl with the idea that the bbc back up and send out program that would certain be broadcast by rival without the state 's contribut , '' johnson said in the communic commiss in the upper hous , as part of the negoti on the bbc 's futur .
if you retain the royalti i am not sure about whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term , the product should be reduc at least in term of programm that do not produc or exclud other .
they broadcast the voic in the main broadcast time becaus they want to get the widest possibl support into the futur .
the idea that no one els would broadcast it is a ridicul joke , and of cours meaningless .
johnson said : `` i do n't understand whi the regress tax should support program that can be fund by no-contributor .
the voic is one of them , eastend next , and understand produc on home soil .
honest , other channel would give their right hand for them .
i ca n't understand how these public broadcast servic are .
i do n't think it would weaken the bbc in the slightest .
johnson , an entrepreneur in the seri that led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , told the bbc he felt vindic by gain rate `` becaus of the ambit of the peopl who work here , and becaus he believ it was the best way to secur long-term support . ''
his comment on the bbc 's most popular show repeat those former execut director sky , toni ball , who use his mactaggart lesson in edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the bbc will sell the show as eastend .
johnson said even the more pamper public servic program of the bbc `` go to bbc4 , where quit often you ca n't measur the audienc , but they fulfil their author and can argu as they prepar for their hypocrit mission to justifi a £4bn incom from royalti , '' but , of cours , we do all these obscur program that no one is look at. ``
they broadcast them at a time when no one is look at them .
as for the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i call on you to find a regress system about who get the best valu from it .
of cours , we all think that 150 british pound a year is a big sum , but for peopl , for whom £150 is a lot , i would be surpris if they pay so much , becaus they do n't look at the bbc so much .
the former director of sky and channel 5 , david elstein , who step down befor the commiss on tuesday , said the bbc should revis it reign mission in term of `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he confirm that a small volum of bbc product has now been classifi as educ - it use to be 1 % televis product and 0.1 % on radio - and should take on a pattern of public public broadcast in australia and canada and chang to `` inform , clarifi and entertain . ''
on the subject of the partnership , elstein said the bbc should do more in area like the prom , which onli a hand were sent off on televis , and to connect with commerci report so that we can all see them onlin .
`` sonogenet '' or control of brain cell by sound wave
this video show how sound impuls influenc the direct the patrol are move .
scientist have rais worm with a genet modifi nervous system that can control sound wave .
tini patrol chang direct by the time they are hit by sound impuls that are inaud to the human ear .
the puls work by switch the cell of genet modifi motor neuron that are program to respond to these ultrason wave .
relat : scientist can read and write brain activ by light
the scientist said these worm are a great demonstr of a new methodolog call sonogenet , which use ultrasound to activ brain , heart and muscl cell and activ outsid the bodi .
sreekanth chalasani , a research at the salk institut in la jolla in california , said for the guardian that this method could one day replac deep brain stimul - an invas procedur in which electrod that stimul the brain are implant in the brain . the method is use , for exampl , to treat the symptom of parkinson 's diseas .
polish usual do not respond to ultrasound , but chalasani found that the reaction occur when place in a liquid contain microscop bubbl .
as he discov , bubbl amplifi ultrason wave that then pass through the bodi of worm .
enhanc ultrason wave oper in the ion channel trp-4 , which is locat in the membran of some worm cell .
thank to the sound wave , these channel are open up and activ the cell they are associ with , the report say in the journal natur communic .
to control the tuber use ultrason wave , chalasani genet modifi the worm so that some of their motor neuron contain the ion channel of trp-4 .
when then use on such modifi worm , the sound wave were amplifi by microbubbl and carri to worm , where modifi motor neuron were switch on .
the new method is akin to optogenet , a pioneer tool that allow scientist to turn on and switch neuron through the light .
but chalasani said that sonogenet could have mani advantag over this techniqu .
unlik the light , which must be sprinkl with optic fibr to the requir site in the brain , ultrason wave can penetr the tissu without restrict and be sent direct to the brain .
`` we believ that when we use gene therapi and therapeut virus , we can target human neuron and make them temporarili sensit to ultrasound signal use in clinic treatment to treat neurolog diseas , '' chalasani said .
he ad that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscl cell and insulin-produc cell .

appl has suffer a yes-y effect .
it 's all on display .
a more power processor , a bigger resolut camera , a firmer scar , or a display that recogn the power of touch , that is in short of the virtu of the recent introduc iphon of the ninth generat .
the two last then also have a negat impact on the dimens and weight of iphon 6s and 6s plus .

the except was onli the third and fourth generat , whose weight increas slight over previous iphon .
inde , the two-gramma mass of the differ to the detriment of the news was neglig .
but this is far from the case for new iphon .
compar to last year 's iphon 6 and 6 plus , weight grew in a smaller model of 14 gram , larger then 20 gram .
one side can not be surpris ; last year , appl 's pocket were great troubl by the blowback in appl 's pocket .
the snack are so out of the more resist aluminium alloy 7000 , which has also been project on the mass .
but a much bigger impact on her have display .
in fact , appl has use a 3d touch technolog that make the display discern the power of touch .
to do so , the display had to be provid with anoth layer of capac sensor .
the mass of display of new iphon has grown more than twice as oppos to previous generat .
for smaller iphon from initi 12 gram to 29 gram , in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 gram .
for iphon 6s , the display is the hardest-us compon .
a weight of just 143 gram is then reach on this news , thank to the defrost bark that touch most of the remain compon .
the larger model is then the hardest part of the batteri , but it weight has not chang in ani way relat to the predecessor .

are cereal breakfast champion for ten of thousand of year ?
in itali 's grotta paglicci , archaeologist have made a find that open up interest possibl .
there were trace of the settlement of modern human from various time , includ wall paint , remnant of tool and so on and so on .
but in a layer of 23a , which , accord to the instrument , date back to about 30,000 year ago , howev , scientist have discov someth veri reminisc of the remnant of the breakfast buffet .
in fact , there were trace of oat in place , which seem to go through the product process today .
in it , the grain dip first today , then dri , dispos of the packag , the so-cal plush , then save and flatter the flat .
in the cave paglicci manag to discov the grain that appear to have been heat or save , and then appar crush between the two mill stone - at least that suggest trace of use on two stone in the cave .

certain , the trolleybus was a littl more noisi , so the messag in the man 's voic was somewhat less comprehens than befor , when the stop sound in the woman 's voic .
the femal voic is higher , so in the deeper nois of traffic , it is better discern than a deeper male voic .
the dpmb argu that this announc was chosen by the passeng themselv - i do n't know who , no one ask me , but i 'm sure they pick up from studio record taken in complet silenc , which , of cours , sound quit differ than in the nois of the bus engin .
i ve live in brno for quit a coupl of decad , so the right name of all those stop are known to me , so i do n't need this report , but foreign from elsewher who do not know in brno , and for whom these report are primarili determin , can be confus and may at the final , where they mistaken arriv , then claim that the footag they had to speak was not report at all .
perhap he would have had the choic of the announc - but better again the announc - to do it again , and this time under the normal traffic nois and the roar of the engin in which the microphon of the speaker on the bus was almost lost .
so that we do not have to continu to listen to the name of the station of the water hershek , the whisper , or then ponor in the creak sage i ve cross in the chamber .
i suppos my old man 's ear had n't grown so much dure the onli day that the announc had chang .

then the chief 's door open and the chief appear .
stiff , stony-fac , in a perfect fit uniform .
`` good morn , chief , '' i said respect , and quick switch on two button of the uniform jacket .
`` good morn , '' came the repli , and i quick ran to the second floor without realiz the cold , omin tone that the old repli .
`` you re play , '' said eva , the elder ladi , who i appreci veri much .
she said she even was a chieftain befor the comrad took her down .
they re clearanc , and you re come in .
how mani time have i ask what these comprehens clearanc are , but no one realli want to talk about it .
they say they re go to be one in three year , they all have to go to them , and it 's pretti unpleas .
at least for some .
i ll see .
i pull the file out of the drawer with period report and then the phone .
`` holcman , come to me right now , '' said the chief 's voic .
what 's bother you ?
now we ve met and noth ... `` i mutter , but no one answer , everyon just with their thought .
`` good morn , comrad chief , i ve come to your order , '' i said , and i walk into the chief 's offic .
the chief sat behind his desk and look at some of the paper .
`` comrad mechan , '' he said after a moment , without rais his head , look care at the paper , `` i do n't like your behavior at all . ''
he threw the paper down on the tabl , lean back in the chair , and stare at me through the usual , unpleas , prick look .
i was uneasi .
what 's go on ?
yesterday , the deputi commend that i had work veri well over the few month in offic , and that i was veri happi with him .
the chief did veri well when he pull me out of the platoon at the distanc .
and now this ?
rememb , you re a track-dist technician , and that 's what you have to do .
the kind of greet you use this morn is just not accept .
i swore i 'd use such a greet sinc i was a kid , that i was so rais and that i did n't see anyth wrong with him .
the chief was like a red rag to the turkey .
`` you re on a socialist rail , and the onli accept greet is the honor of the job , '' the chief said .
plus , you re still confus your superior .
onc you say `` sir , '' for the second time again , `` comrad . ''
but for you , i 'm not mr. chief , but comrad chief .
the deputi are comrad of the deputi , the top tradesman are comrad of the top line-up !
you must rememb that !
excus me , sir ... comrad chief , but ... but i greet you with a regular citizen salut .
there 's noth wrong with that ... and the honor of the job , or comrad ... you know ... i 'm not in the parti ...
`` it 's not your prefer that you re not in the side , '' the chief said , his voic calm .
but that 's what we re talk about .
anyway , rememb , you do n't have a pre-paid retir chair up here .
that was n't good .
when the chief told someon that someth was not his prefer , it did not look good with the concern .
he impal me with a cold , prick look , and i look for the word to answer .
i was also irrit by his haughti .
he was onli a few year older , and he was play god , in fact , a comrad .
jovial , pompous , authoritarian , arrog , as it suit him at the moment .
he was all use to it .
he 's the chief .
in fact , not everyon , the chairman of the parti organ , was like all partisan , but also non-partisan , tycoon .
but the chief tower mani , especi those who could claim his superior .
right now , he was rub me in for a complet tie .
i thought someth about my ass , and it cost me enough power not to shoot him in the face .
but i would not go back to the crusad , let alon continu to make an irrit offici .
what would i support two kid from ?
and set up a hous !
i was cri , but i control myself .
i 'm not gon na give him pleasur .
`` that 's all so far , you can go , '' the audienc said , and began to look close at the paper he had had in his hand .
at 11 : 30 , they call me .
everyon in the offic was alreadi there and on question about what and how , they answer , that it was go to be good .
onli jozhin said soft , as was his habit , that they could n't throw us all away , becaus that job would have to do the co-chief himself with his faith , and that he was not in danger .
the word `` comrad '' point out , as if he knew what the old man had done to me this morn .
there was a nice gather in the chief 's offic .
comrad chief behind his desk and at the long council tabl , other comrad who should have made a decis about my cleric be or not be .

but comrad , yes , the comrad was forg !
the chief motion for me to sit down .
there was a littl soul in me , an unenvi dart in my throat .
the cadav read a report from the civil committe from the resid .
i come from a work famili , i am marri , two children , and so on and so forth .
so far , so good , i thought , and i ve been breath a littl bit better .
then a report from the aisl organ .
he cop a report from the civil committe , perhap both of them were written by the same man .
but then it came !
the parent of long-tim member of the parti , refus to appear befor the screen committe and then withdrew from the parti , report for medic reason .
the chief look at me sharpli .
the cadav notic it and stop read .
the chief nod .
it was onli wors .
i was a member of the citi 's ssm committe and there i was recruit for the parti 's nomine .
regardless of the parent who came out of the parti , the parti gave me confid .
but i got marri and the wed , apart from the nation committe , was also in church .
i have disappoint the parti 's confid in the worst way .
that 's whi i was cut out of her candid .
but that was n't enough !
i had the two children baptiz , and even my mother , when she die , i went to a church funer , though it was a former member of the parti .
all of this give me a negat attitud to the parti 's leadership .
when the cart was finish , onli the tap of the chief 's pencil in the desk was punctuat by a tens silenc .
everyon was stare at me , and i wish i was somewher far away .
in do so , i kept think to myself , `` komunist - superhuman , communist - superpeopl . '' what did i get into ?
whi did n't i stay at the smith ?
i could repair the switch without ani of the fuck clearanc .
but now ?
the career of an irrit offici took hold of her befor she began .
go back to the platoon ?
i do n't think so . i 'm sure the chief will be out for an hour .
`` comrad , how did you investig this comrad ? ''
well , accord to the report from the previous job .
do you have it here ?
the corsag was obvious not twice .
there was a sweat on the glass , nervous blink , as if he had been check himself .
he nod eager and hand the chief some paper .
`` oh , '' said the chief with a hint of granit , but often foreshadow by thunderstorm .
at first sight , he had been prais , teach with honor , studi an industrialist , work in a piecem as a locksmith , the norm fill an averag of a hundr and twenti percent .
but that 's what 's miss .
where did you get that report , comrad ? `` he said , turn back to the cadav , who felt that it was somehow begin to turn against him , and that he might not have had to be a cadav veri soon .
this is the comrad who gave it to me .
is that enough for you ?
`` well , when he got to us , he went to the precinct , '' he said .
and there was n't ani sign of him , he was kind of an extra , so i put it in his file .
`` so when you were assign to the technic function , this piec of paper was enough , '' the chief said dryli .
the cadav blink nervous , and there was no repli .
`` never mind , we ll discuss that later , '' the matter of the chief , appar reliev .
for the time be .
`` what 's the matter with you , comrad ? '' the chief return to me .
all of a sudden , it 's over !
my eye were flood , i felt hot .
there was a torrent of remors and accus , and i knew i was the most disgust creatur in the world who deserv no merci .
by subject the incomplet report , i said , in the mistak of a comrad 's referendum , i did not understand whi the report was incomplet when i receiv it from a cadav in the factori .
i am also an anti-socialist element that , at the time of build real social , support reign religi , or even particip .
that there was a lot of thing i had done , or mayb i was still go to sleep , and i was pray that it would be over .
i did n't care anymor .
i did n't care that i was go to get out of the mechan 's place .
i did n't care that they would take my pick .
this is work for honest and decent peopl , not for the enemi of the peopl i was in the eye of the comrad chief .
`` that 's enough , comrad chief , '' said the parti chairman , interrupt the chief 's leviti .
here the comrad made a mistak , a tremend mistak .
what a mistak , he did the wrong thing !
but he alreadi has his punish !
do n't you forget that , comrad chief !
what could be wors for a young man than to put his door on the side for time !
to open it again , he will have to prove that he has chang to be worthi of our trust again .
the uneduc bachelorett sound like a book .
where did that come from ?
is he so liter or parak phrase from stealth train and meet ?
that 's whi this young comrad must be given a chanc !
a chanc to prove he had chang .
and who should give it to him if not you , comrad chief ?
it is your duti to this young , true , somewhat misguid comrad , to support his effort to repair it !
it 's your parti duti that no one will entertain you !
in fact , it 's a parti oblig for all of us , too .
here the comrad must see that the side has not forgotten him .
that as a kind mother , she not onli punish , but that she also love .
when the presid was finish , no one look up .
no one expect such a turnaround .
at least me .
`` i agre with you , comrad chairman , '' the chief said cold , tri to take the initi again .
if you had let me finish , you would have heard that i was head for that conclus .
everyon nod their head in agreement , but they could see that he did n't believ a word .
`` so i was confirm for the function of a separ refer to the basic mean , '' i said , when i return to my offic , and then i began to cri .
still , in addit to engin evi , everyon was at lunch .
she listen silent to my rambl scene of fresh experi , and i , meanwhil , calm down .
when i finish , she ask if i could have a coffe .
without wait for an answer , she set the water on the stove and set up the cup .
in the meantim , she was talk about disciplinari practic .
as one report , often full of prais , put a man in your hand , and the other in which there is dirt , they send a new employ .
but i did n't end up where i was suppos to be , but on the top of the pick , and so comrad in the factori did n't know where to send it .
and our fellowship ?
he was just old enough to eat or drink , and that 's how it turn out .
`` he ll get it from the old one , '' she said malici .
i 'm sure he wo n't like it today .
keep an eye on him , he 's massiv .
and the parti chairman ?
in fact , a far wors chief , no lidumil .
zero from the pick that have big power .
the coffe began to boil , and then the offic fill with the scent of coffe .
i drop a cube of sugar into the cup and stir the hot potion in silenc .
i hope i 'm the worst out there .
now they do n't throw me out , and there are n't ani more clearanc in three year .
anyway , the comrad chief just wo n't forget today .
it came up in the antholog of the literatur on trati ii in the book .
the symbol of the villag has been reviv .
the round of the windmil over chlum is spin again after year .
you can see it by far , becaus it 's locat at a fifteen-foot-high mast .
peopl from the wide area call him the `` fan of chlum . ''
for the municip , 150 inhabit becam even one of the element of the general emblem that the municip gain to the occas of the resurg of the year in 2010 .
`` we ask for a sign then , and the fan , of cours , want to have one , he know him around everyon , '' said the mayor , georg masek .
the chlum wind pump is a local technic monument .
it is a bit of a memento of the moment : it is reminisc of a time when peopl here have fought for good drink water .
the one in chlum in past centuri was a rariti .
in 1910 , they decid to boast contend for a solut that then suit up to the mid-1980 .
in the villag , they left a deep well in the villag .
three year later , the well was accompani by a still-metal structur with a wind pump that pump water into the reservoir at the highest point of the villag , near the church .
`` the build was carri out by antonin kunc of the hranic on moray 's cargo of 2,400 kronor , '' say a commemor sign on the ground fenc of the construct of the mast .
the pump after sever repair and the wind of the wind farm serv in 1971 .
on may 7 , 1973 , a new chapter of fight began to start .
the wind pump has onli been left with a non-funct general symbol and the local rariti .
the domin got oper at this year 's hometown reunion .
when in 2008 , the chlummi decid to fix the wind round and bring it back on track .
they left a replica of the origin round - reduc to an averag of half a metr .
the wheel was confin to the mast , but it must have been taken down that same year .
the replica produc did not select suitabl materi and the wheel could not withstand wind gust .
then the chlummi domin had been rest under the roof for sever year .
from june this year , howev , the round on the high mast is spin again .
for the occas of the reunion , the villag order the replica of the wheel to adjust and set it back to the top of the iron tower .
but the wheel draw util water from the well just into a rapper 's blind shoulder .
and over the summer , we complet unplug him becaus there was littl water in the well .
at least it was empti .
`` in the autumn , the heat of the windmil from the pump will be remov from the pump in the suction basket again , '' mayor masek explain .
chlum is not the onli municip in the czech republ , where it has put the wind round in the general emblem , but is the onli one of this kind across the highland .
a similar featur in the charact is in honour of the local technic sight , for exampl , in chvalkov and green mountain on vyskaya , in kuželov on hodonin , partutovic , or in polici on vsetínsk .
no hard feel , but i do n't know lafont , she admit to support tripoli goian .
`` the game against slavia i rememb veri well , even my goal , as all in my career , '' the 34-year-old goian smile at the pre-match press confer .
we were train by georgh hagi then , it was too bad we lost .
i hope to score a goal with sparta now .
just the differ that we re not go to lose this time , `` goian continu .
this man , who has play 60 game for romanian represent , is a key support of the greek team .
as a stalwart he will face the raider of the spartan offens .

i ve seen all their match at the time .
i know he 's a veri good attack , so he also went to sparta , goian said .
he did not name anoth soccer player in the pragu club , and so came the direct question of whether he also knew david lafont , the best shooter in the histori of the czech leagu and the captain of sparta .
goian smile and , with a slight reproach look , direct at the czech journalist .
`` whi do you ask me that ? ''
after a moment 's silenc , he drop it .
we saw some video , and i notic that sparta was play a lot of teammat .
he has realli good player .
and lafont ?
no offens , but i do n't know anyon els except fatah .
the spartan know veri well about goian .
`` he has the experi of bigger club , you can say that he hold the defenc of astera , it 's such their organis of the game , '' spartan assist stanislav hejkal observ .

his time was interest in borussia dortmund , stuttgart , both manchest unit unit and citi , from steauy but head to itali 's palermo , also play for the glasgow ranger .
we re expect an aggress and unusu style , the coach say .
sparta is a big team , regular play european leader , pit for victori in the czech leagu .
for me , there 's a favourit in this game , but we re play at home and we want to launch the group with good result .
like sparta , we will tri to win , goian said .
i am in the room with the slovakian goalkeep , toma košic , who is veri pleas with his oppon in the czech republ .

a test of the object of czech televis in inform the migrant crisi .
anoth small test of object and balanc of coverag of the main czech media on the refuge crisi .
this time , the broadcast of the main news session of czech televis .
and how did she stand ?
when they teach journal about how the media can manipul realiti , they can releas today 's broadcast of the czech televis event .
the migrant crisi was devot to about 80 % of the broadcast of the news .
for the first minut , when time report the unrest on the serbian-hungarian border , and the attack of migrant on the polic , she call the euphemist out of patienc - throw stone and attack metal rod , the current proflig propaganda - judg by the name of the individu report .
critic of ngos - larg scope for non-profit organ that critic poor treatment of migrant .

wander the refuge - time has consist use the express of a runner or a refuge and not a migrant .
crucial , it is main that the t in the illustr has been use consist just and onli snapshot on small children and women .
meanwhil , alon in the same broadcast , she said that there were 80 % of the migrant detain in the czech republ .
summari : of the greater part of propaganda that has no preced from communist agit .
i must say , as a former journalist , i am asham of my colleagu .
ecolog in practic .
when i onc recov to the doll 's apart , i soon ceas to be the onli resid .
i had fish in the makeshift toilet .
the fish of the home , an insect with a chang of imperfect , that is , not make the transit from a caterpillar to a beetl , and the cub look like an adult , onli tini and gradual increas .
they were disgust and i hate them .
first hand and later chemic .
the socialist drugmak at their dispos provid some blue crystal .
i think it was call cyclon b .
or someth els ?
but it was done success .
later , i dealt with the pharaoh in the same way .
a box with a kind of juvenil anesthesiologist who carri the ant into the nest , and then he would not allow the queen to generat new offspr .
but i digress .
as time went on , insect becam the subject of my admir , and i becam increas inclin to believ that they had the same right to life as we human .
moreov , i have learn from life that interf in the ecosystem doe not lead to success , and one pest can replac anoth .
the truth with flea and bug , i do n't think i 'd get to exacerb the karma of kill them .
in the new home , my partner and i agre that if they were n't go to be abl to crawl up our neck , they would eat the flake of decay skin , some of those invis eyelash , and the like .
their peac exist was broken by a spider .
it was a common kind of trick that resid in the ceil for a long time .
we were suppos to live from the occasion mucus and mosquito , which onli heighten comfort .
becaus he had live with us for sever year , we discov that they were main fed , and that their number seem to maintain their number .
a confidenti regular contact with each carri out we found that it was a femal .
in fact , we were see romant talk with a partner about a third of the smaller , as care tint on the strand of the web , so that it would not be eaten befor it reach the desir excav .
it took about three day that they did not move and did not respond to our check .
beneath the toilet bowl , where the love game were take place , we found the remain of a dried-up male next to the femal .
then the spider did not move for week .
when we thought it was over , we were surpris by the number of littl spider hang from her surround .
they soon disappear .
they were eaten away by their mother , and they ran away .
even the femal has gone miss after a week .
if she went away or die , we do n't know , but after a month or two , she show up on the ceil again .
right , a littl smaller , probabl the daughter of that great-look toilet .
for some time from the ceil , she watch our behavior care , and move under the toilet bowl to assess our aggress as a friendship .
the number of somewhat-hyp fish were reduc again , and the spider slowli look at it normal activ to provid food .
all year , our ecosystem has n't chang .
our daughter among this has reach an age where the use of the potter has been a disgrac .
we have toler it so far , but the etern heal of it content has alreadi been given to us .
we pick it up more strong to use the toilet .
her daughter , howev , had found an excus in that spider she had seen veri well .
our talk of have a spider seen ... ... has never taken ani happi in the hous .
cri and scream , she forc her trouser .
there was no other way .
there was a time when a spider had to be , in the interest of a daughter 's develop , to command .
it 's all down to me .
he was trap in a glass and banish across the balconi into the garden .
i use to say goodby to him as a friend , but i still felt loath after such a long experi as if i was throw a relat .
we assum that the fish would begin to appear more often and begin to multipli by a geometr seri .
wonder , week , two , we have n't found ani .
i began to specul on the caus .
i wonder if there was a spider in the direct of the ant , somehow , that the bathroom environ was not as conduc to their exist as we thought .
but then the first bit of midsiz came , and they were bustl again .
i had to think of anoth theori about the caus of their disappear , and i found that their link to the spider must have had a caus in that when they could n't see it , that it was hidden in some other place , and that they were in danger from anywher .
or mayb they had some kind of telepath connect to their predat , and his rapid disappear trigger some sort of alarm .
it 's more that i have no illus about their eyesight .
some light plaqu show , but that they would react to wave arm or fast movement , no .
my daughter goe to the bathroom on a regular basi .
i think she 's forgotten the potti .
all we have to do is attract a spider .
i 'm alreadi send my wish to the ether , and i hope they have n't turn on me after the execut .
otherwis , we 'd have to use that cyclon b .
the ten command of albert einstein , which has enrich the world .
the prophet of the genius of the last centuri may never have been fascin by mankind .
he was abl to immers himself so deep that the creation was alway a stun find .
albert einstein ( 1879-1955 ) was one of the most import scientist of all time .
in particular , the awar of peopl has enter it special and general theori of relat , which , so far , is best describ by the univers in it gigant proport .
it is also imposs to ignor it explan of the photoeffect or the idea of quantum electromagnet field .
there is no doubt that the desktop itself , and the system of knowledg of the popular theori of relat , is so complex for mani that they prefer to becom easy-to-d .
but it is not easi .
but it would n't be albert einstein , if he could not find a brilliant simplifi form of explan : an hour in the vicin of your lover seem a minut ; a minut in a hot oven seem an hour - and that 's relat .
i allow myself from his entir plead of famous quot to pick up these ten , which liter captiv me .
intellig peopl tri to solv problem , genius is tri not to do them .
onli two thing are endless .
space and human stupid .
i 'm not so sure about the first one .
no amount of attempt can ever prove that i was right .
but one could prove that i was wrong .
but it 's a sad time when it 's easier to smash an atom than destroy prejudic .
if the mess is a reflect of the mess in the mind , what then reflect the empti tabl ?
i do n't know what will fight in the third world war , but in that fourth it will be stick and stone .
there are thousand of way to kill time , but no way to resurrect it .
know littl is danger and know too much .
if i had an hour to master the problem my life depend on , i would spend 40 minut of his studi , 15 minut of his analysi and 5 minut of his solut .
in the world the hardest thing to understand the incom tax .
at the end of the day , i can not forgiv myself for fail to guid einstein 's definit of success : by take a for success , the formula is : and = x + y + z , where x is a work , y rest , and z is to keep it mouth shut .
new and modern .
hospit in the zlín region are expect chang in 1.5 billion .
`` it 's a success consid that all of this year , all four are held in black number , '' said contend stanislav mišák .
the total profit of region facil is about $ 32 million at this time .
the stake in this are main higher payment from insur compani , which are equal favour for this year .
even this fact show that after poor year , hospit can final afford more invest .
in kron , visi , uherski hradiště and zlín , it is due to the build , which togeth will cost almost £1.5 billion .
the long period when we were shop main devic end .
now we have to start build new build , becaus without them , high-tech health ca n't be done , the counti deputi 's plan for health care have been justifi .
he enjoy the chang at all hospit .
the builder will come to the hospit next year .
in visi , they now select the supplier of the new intern pavilion for near $ 300 million .

and the head of baze 's hospit await the long-delay construct of a new central incom and an interst that will requir three quarter of a billion .
in all case , it is crucial and often the biggest chang in recent year .
`` this is an extrem import step for the whole region , patient , and doctor , '' she said , for exampl , to the construct of the hospit , the director of the hospit , vera proust .
the five-stori build is due to be done in about two year and offer comfort amen for the intern and neurolog , dialysi , new ambul , bed , and intens care .
more comfort for patient .
chang that are signific identifi by patient will be touch by all region .
in fact , the new build will be replac by those in which , for exampl , there are mani suffer on one room , on the floor they have onli one toilet , bed are unloan , the window are not tight , and the paramed do n't have adequ condit for the job .
`` our intern , for exampl , was built thirty-f year ago , and now he 's on the edg of his life , '' the head of the zola hospit , pavel calábek , point out .
within a few year , it will be replac by a seven-storey modern build link to an urgent incom .

no one has explain how i should keep the refuge in the countri when they do not want to live in the czech republ .
the interior minist , milan chovanec ( čssd ) , has complain after negoti with his european colleagu that the other state of the czech republ are push to adopt quota for refuge redistribut , but reject ani discuss .
he also observ that he has not yet been told how he should keep the alloc refuge in the czech republ when they do not want to live with us anyway .
`` we did n't get the answer , and that 's whi we want the quota to be releas from the final text , '' chovanec told report .
can you , more specif , describ the posit you came to be at the meet of the eu 's foreign minist and the european union ?
we disagre with mandatori quota as a system that just ca n't function .
we ca n't talk about migrant like bag of salt or flour .
they re live creatur that have some vision , they re go somewher , they have some relat .
we want to hear from colleagu how we were abl to keep migrant in the territori of the member state if they were redistribut .
we ca n't imagin .
we did n't get the answer , and that 's whi we want the quota to be releas from the final text .
with the other conclus - function hotspot , registr place , border protect , camp outsid europ , a trust fund for african countri and other thing , we have no problem with that .
we ve been talk about this for a year and we re say this is the way .
but say quota will solv everyth ?
we ve done forti grand a littl while ago , now it 's a hundr and twenti thousand .
when will it be five hundr thousand ?
and how do we keep those peopl in that territori ?
ninety-eight percent of all peopl cross us want to go to germani .
there 's almost no one for us , we just do n't know how to hold them here .
we have the ambit to walk by other foreign , ukrainian , vietnames , and other who take the czech republ as a target countri , they are gain asylum on us , but the interest of peopl from this migratori wave , from syria and other countri , is limit close to zero .
you mention that the refuge do n't actual want us , but fifteen hundr peopl have alreadi pledg to accept .
would it not be possibl to accept more of them ?
we have pledg to accept 1500 peopl , but with the condit .
we said : function hotspot , border protect , militari oper .
even with the 1,500 , there 's go to be 1100 peopl with whom we can deal with an asylum procedur .
they will come into our detent facil and treat them as much as to those we have captur .
it is a big issu , and we will debat it with europ if we can hold peopl to be regist in itali and greec , possibl in hungari .
becaus europ is behav in such a way that if they have a registr , they can not be detain .
that mean , they will come to our territori with the registr , and if there is a deal that is not yet , it may be that we will not hold that 1100 in the czech republ and they will go back to germani after arriv .
if we can restrain them for the durat of the asylum procedur , we will deal with them in an asylum procedur .
if it is the citizen of syria , eritrea , almost 98 per cent , accord to european statist , receiv intern protect .
then they get the paper that will allow them to travel across europ .
and i think these peopl will end up in the target countri again .
then there are four hundr peopl who will be reloc .
that 's the second project that 's been break up so far , and we ve made progress onli by debat the church about the possibl that they should help them get job , accommod and so on .
but that 's a run for a veri long line .
you said that at the meet of minist with us , the other state were unwil to discuss .
but is it not that the czech republ onli reject quota , but offer no solidar step that would block the debat ?
and what exact doe that take to be a solid step ?
if the feder republ of germani say an incent that all migrant from syria can join them , the messag spread in the hour of all the camp across europ , but also in turkey , jordan .
it encourag anoth migratori wave that goe to germani becaus they just do n't want us to .
we think the road is to protect the extern border - just to discourag those migratori wave , to help the needi , and to separ econom migrant .
to show them that they do n't stand a chanc .
fifti thousand kosovan came to germani last year alon .
from secur kosovo , where we pay all the satur of this state , includ the polic , the court , the prosecutor 's offic .
if we could separ them and not accept them or accept them onli accord to the need of the economi , that fifti per cent of what social-welfar system would spend on them today could go to refuge .
contrari to the first day that germani had implement the control , the number of detaine in the czech republ jump .
now it 's eighti , the first day it was 12 .
where should it go to tighten control on the border ?
we were afraid of a glitch in the order of hundr of peopl .
these are the number we re manag .
we still have a few hundr vacanc in stone detent .
of cours , all the peopl we hold will return to austria within seven day .
we do it by default .
the austrian are the onli one take these peopl , with hungari it 's complex and the greek - that 's a complet useless stori .
so where is the break point ?
would it have to be a thousand a day ?
i think it would have to be a coupl of hundr a day .
two hundr , three hundr peopl a day for two , three consecut day will exhaust our capac enough to make conting plan .
then i agre with the prime minist that he would immedi call an extraordinari govern .
he 's veri interest in the whole thing , we re in telephon contact a few time a day .
if the situat aris , the govern can sit down in forc immedi , and by one resolut , it would decid to strengthen the polic on the militari , say , the custom administr , or the prison servic .
the extrem option is the state of emerg , which has now been declar in some place by hungari ?
i do n't think it can come this far .
keep in mind that our posit is differ , we are a nation state within europ , we have the schengen border onli and onli at the airport .
i do n't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the territori of the czech republ , i do n't want to spread the alarm .
all the inform we have , whether from moldova , serbia , hungari , suggest that hungarian will attempt to divert migrat flow to croatia and slovenia , which would then be a direct rout to austria .
the czech republ would be affect veri margin , almost at all .

they end tuesday with a declin of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of june 11 .
at it most anticip meet in year , feder reserv lawmak will spend two day seat at the 27-foot-long honorean mahogani tabl , and will decid whether , after near a decad , the time has come to rais the key interest rate .
tower abov them at one end of the central bank 's ornament , the two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that chair fed janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to give the nation 's econom interest abov all els .
the central bank has a doubl charg of congress : maxim us employ and keep price stabl .
but , sinc the great recess , fed offici acknowledg that there is an unwritten third term : financi stabil .
and this third term could be the x-factor in too close to the predict decis to be announc on thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to launch in wean off an unpreced stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
although most of the data show solid growth in the economi , the recent turbul in the world 's financi market could alreadi scare the wari fed for ad to volatil by rais it benchmark feder fund rate - and no more than just a quarter of a percentag point .
`` it is obvious that the labor market and inflat will be the most import thing to watch in the first place , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at broker stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think they were just look for an excus to not increas the extent , the increas uncertainti surround the global market is alreadi provid them with suffici justif to wait , '' she said .
there is no consensus about what the fed will do , which itself is the caus of nervous in financi market .
about half of economist recent ask blomberg to rais rate this week .
howev , financi market expect the fed to delay the matter , with a key indic of onli about a 30 % chanc of an increas .
this would point to a declin in the stock market in the event that the fed rais rate onli if policymak make a dent in the promis that the next increas is not in sight .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228,89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16 599.85 .
the ralli was run by expect that the fed 's decis to delay rate this week in peac , say john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed now rais rate , '' he say .
if policymak were to do so , `` they would have to go all the way to the extrem in their program statement , and hold financi market for them not to panic . ''
other expert argu that rais rate would reassur financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about how the fed would proceed .
just a month ago , the fed seem on a good path to rais rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in the slow tighten of monetari condit that would confirm the strength of the econom recoveri in the us .
yellen said that over the spring and earli summer , he expect to rais rate this year despit complaint from the liber that more econom progress is need .
even when job creation slow in august , the labor market saw solid growth this year .
the unemploy rate has fallen to 5.1 % in the previous month , the lowest in more than seven year and is close to the level that the fed consid full employ .
wage gain show sign of lift .
and even if inflat continu to be under the annual 2 % target of the central bank , the fed 's policymak argu that the main reason was the temporari effect of signific lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate and need them , with regard to the crowd in the labour market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world began thrash in late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag fell as much as 16 % below it record valu in may as investor fear that a slowdown in china 's economi would pull down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , and the dow is now lose onli near 10 % of the may peak .
the fed 's polici maker are make the uneasi situat in the market a comprehens calcul when an interest rate rise is count .
`` in the absenc of what has happen in financi market , and report of weak in the chines economi in the last few week , there would be a tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , lead research at ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
he now predict he will wait for at least a month to get better control over the consequ .
`` there is a lot of uncertainti about the impact this will have on the us economi , and they have almost no data on which to reli on the latest develop in china , '' olin said .
the global economi 's health is not one of the fed 's main concern , so technic it should not be includ in their decision-mak .
but in fact , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint of then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed could `` narrow down '' their monetari expans in the market has trigger crash around the world .
in a world where market and economi are still more close align , fed offici can be expect to follow develop elsewher , but also consult with other central banker and expert in order to better read the global economi 's status .
their decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank in richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of exagger with movement in financi market that seem disjoint with econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the feder open market committe 's polici make push to rais rate , cite the 1998-99 decis as an exampl .
the financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point dure the three session `` despit the limit identifi effect on growth in the us , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici turn these cut .
the fed should prioritis concern about financi stabil onli dure the big crisi , such as the market meltdown of 2008 , said adam posen s. , a former member of the board of stand committe at the bank of england .
the latest turmoil doe n't even come close to this level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be in a posit of fear of a rate hike becaus market have been upset , '' said posen , presid of the institut for intern econom , peterson .
the feder reserv act still has a dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that chang , i do n't think they should be get on top .

they were dress like an american rap movi .
on top of the hat with a fingernail , white and colour adidass on the leg .
then they circl the local beach bar and began to feast .
they put the tabl around , cram in besid the sit snow and white guest of the bar - read to muslim and european without ask .
mother and children fled from the dine terrac to a quiet place .
incom black peopl drank beer straight from the third - how in the usa ? ! - on the beach , they threw empti bottl around each other .
they kept yell at each other .
it was not english , though .
then they got into a drink of wine , also straight from the bottl .
they jump into the hotel pool - in design bath suit , especi the young ladi - in the water scream and yell , mother with children and pension fled in dismay , and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool or one non-black guest .
they ve all gone .
regardless of whether he was a christian or a muslim .
the hotel staff were afraid to speak of them .
the waiter said to me in the even , `` did you see the gold they were wear ? ''
`` yeah , '' i said .
`` well , they certain did n't , '' said the waiter .
i thought : `` i know , they all had massiv gold chain around the neck .
and one was on his neck about a 20-centimet massiv cross from gold .
and women were like gold .
`` drug smuggler ? '' i ask .
`` you ve seen them boo , '' the waiter repli .
drug do n't fit , they do n't even use .
they re smuggl someth els entir .
so i knew what they were smuggl .
howev , in june 2105 , it was still not that import to me .
i had no idea what would follow .
but the secret servic and top politician should have known it first .
they do n't seem to know .
about 1.5 million immigr went to europ at the time .
and they go and go and go .
today , the main problem for the european union is that totalitarian-politicis politician , as intellectu , and tie to them by lobbi and econom import group , have the greatest strength in europ .
germani and it politician - now a public recogn taskforc in europ - lie , lie and lie - but not just them , also eu leader and televis , includ our .
for exampl , recent televis imag on the enthusiast welcom of refuge in germani are at the level of imag of moscow televis in august 1968 .
of cours , there were a few slut at the station , but most - old german - muslim welcom their soulmat .
for week , they were babbl on the news on czech televis , as , accord to some research , the german were almost all for the arriv of emigr .
howev , who was just a coupl of day in germani , he know it 's a lie like a tower .
which confirm more inform .
for exampl , famous public opinion research organ by the ard - the czech associ of public televis compani of the feder republ of germani .
accord to the statement , ard want more than 50 % of german to accept even more refuge a week ago .
that also meld our televis .
howev , they conceal what had been snap in germani the next day : that in an anticlimact vote to the articl it turn out that 94.5 per cent of german no longer want ani immigr - the poll involv 67 000 peopl .
it is true that chancellor merkel in public in novemb 2010 , five year ago , said : `` our effort to develop a multi-cult societi have total fail . ''
she then said : `` germani is give up the fight for a multicultur societi . ''
`` all effort to live togeth have fail . ''
in a countri where four million muslim live , it has fail to identifi strategi that allow peopl from differ cultur background to live side by side without be integr .
but that is not the realiti .
the multicultur approach , when we say we just live happili alongsid each other , so this approach has fail .
he 's complet fail .
but even merkel may not have the strength to go against the power germani and europ , and especi against polit correct .
it show an escal of event .
conflict is increas rapid .
euromut schulz , the presid of the european parliament , the mp for the spd , the onli one in the euro-parlia who report doe not even have a graduat - yes , that is the one that berlusconi has said in the eu parliament that he could play a supervisor in a concentr - as he has done befor .
it seem , in particular , under the impress of the recent statement by german politician that germani had cross the rubicon .
note that , except for some , most european politician do not support these statement , the stat of countri that were victim of nazism are appal .
what happen to the german ?
with the rich , success and solid german ?
who have tri for year , at least outward , to deal with their terribl past the aggressor and the killer of million ?
are they right to say that in germani 's soul , is the devil of aggress , superior , and violenc ?
did the chancellor , otto von bismarck , have been right , when all his strength halt the highland ' attempt to control the whole of the centr of europ ?
when did he say that the welsh idea would destroy germani ?
i guess he should have .
when they shut it down , it began prepar for world war i .
the idea of the welsh govern , which led the german and europ into two war that cost million of live , probabl came back in anoth form .
after the marxist ' attempt to domin the state , for exampl , with the rote arme fraktion , and after the failur of the ndr , in germani on the basi of ecolog , for exampl , which was one of the main idea of nazism , a new german ideolog began to develop .
we 'd say sunshin .
germani 's elit have long resist the emerg of german nation , leav all those fighter against the atom , the enthusiast seek paradis for all , to quiet promot the old empir and nazi motto our forest must live .
to satisfi the restless young peopl who everywher want to do someth differ and better , they have fulli embrac the anti-warm parti , stop nuclear power plant , etc .
and they have forgotten that there is also a strong anti-semit - so-cal pro-palestinian - and anti-slav stream that has seen all the slav as difficult vermin - sinc karl marx , who , after his parent , a jew , was a german nationalist .
and , as the last statement by schulz and german minster show , open threaten the disobedi eastern state , the idea of the leader of germani .
which must be listen to without speak .
otherwis , woe to you !
and when we say that immigr are a veri influenc group of voter , we have what we have .
and , behind this , it stand as alway the capit , especi the german that it suit , and which is that germani actual control most of europ 's bank and the union .
it has led the german into swamp of environment and multicoltur , and has brought them home and bring about million of muslim .
who , lure by the voic of the siren , will encount soon on the wall of realiti that merkel doe not want to see , and start to revolt .
germani can , onc again , threaten it neighbor by forc , again it may be a part of it popul - but , it seem , an increas small part - ideolog infatu , but in the end , the realiti is as it alway doe .
will germani burn again ?
muslim dormitori are alreadi on fire .
what will the german govern do when public protest from german against incom islamist erupt ?
to whom muslim will come for long live in germani , but certain not assimil to take over local custom and law ?
what will the german govern do when natur muslim , incom islamist and german , follow the fear of islam of their countri ?
what will it do with the german , and with germani , when the peopl who are rais loud and public protest against a new euro-overs muslim ?
germani has just chang .
the conflict that has creat the promot of sunshin ideolog in europ , the ideolog of the elitist and essenti totalitarian , and it greedi bank , is grow .
and becaus of the blunt negoti toward disobedi democrat german and all the inferior and disobedi eastern neighbor , this can not be done well .
finish tomorrow .
the best way to get rid of pushi retail : scare them to death .
all you have to do is knock and grind on you both in a way that a weaker natur doe n't have to stop .
a revil head will set you down and drive the rag one , too , to walk away ( or , rather , drive ) an insist seller and a revil statu .
mayb it 's too bad that you ca n't even get a talk knockoff .
even with us , there would be plenti of gutter and shiver .

as the day approach , i 'm begin to worri .
whi am i do this ?
i have accept this invit becaus it is a good way for me to tell you the whole stori of the death penalti .
it would offer me a uniqu perspect .
it is true that journalist are allow to watch execut in america and becaus there are often more request than vacanc , it is carri out with a morbid lotteri to decid who will be elect .
oklahoma has cut the number of seat for journalist from 12 to five .
whoever will be select will watch the whole execut unbias .
i ca n't do that .
i ll be sit alongsid richard glossian 's closest friend , and i ve made a special bond with him through month of phone call and a two-and-a-half hour visit .
i like that kid .
we laugh often when we talk .
the prison administr say i ca n't be a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be abl to get a notebook , and i wo n't be abl to record what i see .
i ll just have to memor all the detail .

i 'm not go to repeat all the detail .
i ca n't say for sure that richard glossip is innoc .
his action follow the murder of barri van tree would make him guilti of complic in the crime .
but i believ there is a great likelihood that he is innoc of murder .
i certain believ there was not enough evid to justifi the death penalti .
in my opinion , the execut is bad .
and it is from this perspect that i will watch his death .
i ca n't say i 'm realli object .
to this end , you can turn to other journalist .
what you get from me is an experi of see a man i love to die an unnecessari death .

this best-cas scenario alreadi mean wilsher will sure miss at least anoth four english game and , from the perspect of histori , his involv in the next summer 's european championship , is obvious uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that wilsher end last season strong after an ankl injuri and then went back to the former form dure the pre-season .
`` this kind of injuri doe n't threaten the career , '' wenger say .
it 's a wound that requir heal .
this is noth special .
it was just an accid .
it did not concern his ankl or injuri he suffer befor .
this could be from a pure medic point of view , as wenger admit that there is a relat risk of further injuri whenev ani player return dure the season .
here , too , a nasti pattern emerg .
the survey by premier injuri ltd record 23 differ injuri to wilsher sinc he had his game debut six year ago .

dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 game after they kept the campaign `` unbeat '' last season .
the stadium was rock by an earthquak of 3.2 degre on wednesday night .

the second goal final came after an hour 's game thank to cavani , this uruguayan header sent off for a line-out in the sixth goal this season after ibrahimov nail him down the pitch from maxwel 's left wing .
that end malma 's thought about the possibl that they might gain someth out of the game , and onli a great save by wilanda from the great vicin wreck the hope of david luiz , and the score remain unchang even as the goal of the shoot ezequiel lavezzi was unrecognis at the end of the match .
