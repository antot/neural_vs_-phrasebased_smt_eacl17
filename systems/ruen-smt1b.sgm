<seg id="1">During a call to 911 teacher admits to killing girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">During the 911 call, almost without a voice teacher Shannon Lamb told police that the school tremhas shot his girlfriend and what needed employees who would come home to them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb stressed that the house has a "pösik," which is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of family members who died can be found in her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, police discovered the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly written off his hands on a white piece of paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like to line everything in the back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to the authorities, signed by Lambom.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is nothing to indicate that, who has conducted two online courses at the University of Delta Lamb in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel for 300 miles into a university campus where, according to police, he shot all respected teacher history Itana Schmidt on the doorstep of his cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="6">University of Delta police chief Lynn Buford reported that university staff found out about the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He reported that he made the truthful call to 911 shortly after the Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, the victims will prove one more: as soon as the police surrounded him, Lamb committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="9">The next day, after the shooting at the training facility forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to fold into one picture of the motives that led Lamba.</seg>
<seg id="10">The information, which was shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped create a portrait of a talented, but perhaps anxious teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">The students were told that they were really looking forward to his classes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gotye, where Prentiss died, reported that no charges of violence or criminal counts for him.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book written by him, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "wonderful people," with whom he had crossed in his teaching life.</seg>
<seg id="14">They both taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, which counts 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">One student, who had good cheer about Lambe, Brandon Bivers said he also seemed worried and nervous, "as if something had been raised with him not in order."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 told Lamb about how he struggled with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">He had previously asked the University of Delta to provide sick leave for Lamb, saying that he had some health problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only at two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor who worked so hard on getting that job would not guarantee him an automatic teacher Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William Laforges said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr Lamba had something on his mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to respond.</seg>
<seg id="23">Police attacked Lamba trail after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before they were able to arrest him, Lamb shot himself from charging 38 caliber guns left in the back yard of noone mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi home, told county coroner Washington metel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car with the engine running still stood on the access road.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was unclear why Lamb came to this house, unskilled, though, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew people who were living in it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in those edges.</seg>
<seg id="28">He began working at the university, which counts 3,500 students in Lamb in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.</seg>
<seg id="30">One longtime friend Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful person.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carl Hairston said that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they were introduced through mutual friends from Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy, who for several years tried to teach her she would play the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">In those years, he enjoyed success with women.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melt when he was there," said Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, suburban Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">And Prentiss at the time of events, apparently, Lamb had already met for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">During a call to 911, Lamb said: "I killed my wife but there is no record of their marriage registration."</seg>
<seg id="37">The couple had dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gotye in a brick house, the flip side of which goes to the canal.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to police, with the dog all right.</seg>
<seg id="39">The former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends, and that they have a daughter, who is now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She's totally devastated," O'Steen said about her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had not met, but heard from his daughter EbigLambale that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentice was a nurse and worked online at different companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator for entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gotye, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was nothing suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We had fun and were teaching each other over stuffed.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the sense that they were both very smart.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, who died a teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American history and colonial America," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">The campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, took part in a memorial ceremony of lighting the candles.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to return our students," Laforges said.</seg>
<seg id="59">Crisis passed.</seg>
<seg id="60">Today is the day of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Reporting helped to prepare the Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.</seg>
<seg id="63">The material has been edited in connection with a police statement saying that the call Lamba entered the service 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as due to the fact that while his wife and spoke about Prentiss as the Lamb, when they called 911, information about whether they were married, was not confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 survey results, which show that Donald Trump doesn't jokes</seg>
<seg id="2">Some tried to hang on him a shortcut to the puller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have shrugged off the him, taking up as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some require a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to shake Donald Trump's high standing in poll results, they failed (so far).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the real estate tycoon in terms of chances to get the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this means that Trump has a chance for Republican nominees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts pointed out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry had succumbed to his prechesin gaining popularity with Herman Keim, none of whom has not won him and one state well during the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are plenty of reasons why he would want to fight the general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups, such as the "Supercommittee" and Jeb Bush's economic and foreign policy conservative assembly group recognize Trump's unrelenting power of "growth" and families are starting to get their dollars to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the property magnate is not just an interim phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">The ratings of sympathy for Trump turned around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to this real estate tycoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Tramp.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And all these indicators are victories over the initial stages.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans are there to put.; Tramp</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have made Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/Orc poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "pleased" or with "enthusiasm," if Trump became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 said they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would react "with delight" versus 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trempe).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next level of delight?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "not satisfied" or "upset" if establishment favourite Jeb Bush will be the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent inclined to Republican voters across the country, think the magnate suitable temperament to be president, as ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday showed.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same figure appears on the country's first closed-door meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he is the man who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44 per cent think he is not a man who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Izbirately-Republicans get used to that thought.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they wear their hats of connoisseurs, elected Republicans think Trump is seriously prodigy.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was the favourite, according to a CNN/Orc poll last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no longer the case, when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters have previously not been properly magical Cristal.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the same time in the last cycle of cycle four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the eventual candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters believe Trump's campaign is convincing.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans would have rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some pundits point out that this variation is likely to play at Trump's advantage, and at the same time not supporting Trump evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="42">He outscored Carli Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Randa Paul, John Keisich and Chris Christie on 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">He has a draw with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson overtook the businessman on entire 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one by one."</seg>
<seg id="46">A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say that they have changed their mind.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT poll, conducted Tuesday, shows that just over half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their voices.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, Trump's most tense competition from the rain at the moment - with queasy outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson St, but voters who say that they have changed their mind is more likely to choose Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump over immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" in his speech opening campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most urgent in our conversations in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some worry that Trump's posturing would undermine key voter Hispanics from the Republican Party and turn away rebranding.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, until immigration draws widespread attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the government is gaining new momentum.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status ers-outsiders.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they'd rather want a political outsider than a person with experience in government.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also hurt at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa disappointed the activities of Republicans in Congress, while 54 percent were "unsatisfied," and 21 percent "furious."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn debuts in session of Prime Minister questions</seg>
<seg id="2">After the election of Mr Corbyn on his debut at the session questions the Prime Minister is expected to look great</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be in session for the first time Prime Minister, for the first time by merissues forces with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will perform with the first of six allocated questions during the second half of the day; his performance is likely to be closely follow the press and members of the Parliament from the Labour Party.</seg>
<seg id="5">He issued a call for "less theater and more facts" at the weekly demonstration speech.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn as leader; it will happen after the appointment of his shadow cabinet and speech at the annual congress of trade union locations Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of Battle for Britain has provoked criticism from some conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has garnered attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokeswoman for Mr Corbyn said he "stood in respectful silence" and admitted "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC Two that he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his conviction of the need to abolish the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play in Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on issues of economy, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party members backed him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "digging up" in the Labour Party after his appointment of Mr Corbyn's office in the European Union and restrictions on government compensation payments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn said at a conference of trade union that the Labour Party has made amendments aimed at harvested the very idea of restrictions in general cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said the party had "full clarity" on account of the fact that it exists in opposition to government plans to reduce the upper limit with only 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader, with whom David Cameron will meet the "express" over the past decade's box since he became leader of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, declares that he "drew collective resources" in order to gain an idea Mr Cameron questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.</seg>
<seg id="18">A member of Parliament from Aylington Nort District stated that Prime Minister questions cause excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from witty responses and exchange knees, instead promising to focus on serious issues of bones, such as poverty, inequality and challenges to the youth.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the economy minister in shadow cabinet, will replace him on matters of prime minister, when he will be absent - for example, when removing Mr Cameron is abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also voiced the idea of letting other colleagues take the word when possible, saying that he was referring to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">Becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron has said he wants to move away from the political style of "vintage Balagan," often ar associated with the procedure, but admitted a few years later that he questions the Prime Minister did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since its first broadcast in 1990, the prime minister has become a key indicator of the leader's views and questions their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has turned into a caricature and requires major reforms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash is launching a campaign on the initiative from below to fight the onslaught of Aldi</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wholesale food supplier on the initiative from below has launched a campaign to protect the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million injection by Aldi.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and at events like the "Adelaide Show.</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign to join retailers and IGA suppliers, such as ice-cream maker Simmo's of Dansborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League matches regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to expand more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - a day when will this wholesale supplier of food, alcoholic drinks and household goods will hold its annual investor day strategies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Much is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the IGA brand account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as followers of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for the IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in JA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will turn 5 percent of the food market in these two states declared within 12 months after opening its first stores, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that the IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, having achieved sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">Loss of revenue and food sales volumes at high levels of fixed costs Metcash could cost the company about 13 million earnings before paying interest and taxes, says Mr Kirat.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that's what a recent study at the company Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.</seg>
<seg id="14">At Morgan Stanley think Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, at 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading stock manager Hamish Дуглass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, spotted attending a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash has refused to publicly comment on the comments made by Mr Дуглassa.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is expected that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr Douglassom last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">The share of IGA on the market has declined from 18 to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash revenues from business in the food sector, which the company delivers approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational performance and due to pressure on sales and profitability делеверija.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually for equalization of retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths over a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers in trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of reconstituted fresh products and a broader selection of branded food.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that the equalization of prices and re-equipment of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves the honor, rather than criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyryos and for his behaviour deserves the honor more than critics, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, a junior in the talented duo and often called "Special KS," unwittingly found himself in the spotlight because of the shameful Kiriosa shouting matches with Stan Vavrinka at Montreal Masters tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shortly after that, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinatti judge the tower had to twice get to Kokkinakis and his opponent standing Ryan Harrisona, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to lay on the blades of Kiriosa, and I should lay paddles this guy."</seg>
<seg id="6">Since Kokkinakis last seen breaking his racket after which cramp in his leg saved Rishara Gasquet from possible defeat at the US Open, Hili devotedly protects Kokkinakis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groupon for being eligible to be second to Bernard Tomic in the singles semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I badly worry about one thing, namely that Tanashi pulled into conflict," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He really broke a racquet when he got his leg at the US Open, but he was not the first player swing, which broke his racket when broke down, and I know Tanashi well enough to hope that he would not be proud of this to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in fact he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations at US, with Harrisons, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that with him came a little bit dishonest.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he has a lot of work, perfectly fits into the team, he has never had a problem with other players, his respect outside the court, he's intense, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated train and developed young man, and I think that made him should be assessed on its merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiriosa for the sake of an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" the right way out for everyone, but counting that guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we want to make sure that the team is fully focused on the match rather than the debate around [Kiriosa]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick gained momentum very quickly, which prove people like Federer and Marraya, he grows in front of the audience, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the implications of their actions, and necessary, I believe, to withdraw it from the center of attention for some time so he can reflect on them, and it's best for the team and best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Migrant crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, delays migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia at the southern border and delays those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants flowing inside.</seg>
<seg id="3">There were hundreds of migrants at the border on the border territory - inflamed unrest that Serbian authorities sharply reacted negatively.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anchored in indefinitely at the site between the two countries' border crossing points, the road people fleeing armed violence at home, smashed tents and settled in the area.</seg>
<seg id="5">But discontent was growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a police helicopter was circling above them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police special.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some abandoned food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister declared "unacceptable" deportation of migrants back from Hungary, when they are more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">Serbia wants to be part of the solution, rather than collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is necessary in the coming days to negotiate with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers agreed to bear overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) would have reached an agreement under which EU members would take another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to gather next week an emergency EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, does not hope for quick action on the part of Brussels or old neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Announced on Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to act in relation to the crisis, which allowed them to shut down roads and speed up court cases of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijarya said his country also plans to build a fence from the barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to halt the flow of migrants through the land, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border country.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work on completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and EU border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and Middle East countries.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nevertheless, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants, looking for a more prosperous life rather than refugees - the victims of military action, which are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which joined in Hungary into force at midnight, now considered a crime crossing or damage to a 4-meter (13-foot) fence of barbed wire, the government-built port along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We clearly make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Formally parliament still must authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, has already been there for several days watching the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="24">Orban's Bakondi, an adviser to Djerring on national security, said the authorized bodies of 45 people caught attempting to cross the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities quickly restore the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven passes on the border with Serbia, ready to block one of the passes a railway carriage, unwrapping a barbed wire.</seg>
<seg id="28">Riots broke out at the main passage across the border near the town of Rioske (Hungary), as Hungarians posted an official premises for missing people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break inside.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 persons managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway leading from Serbia into Hungary, and declared the race to refuse food and water until they did not miss from Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders-goes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent hers).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters ers-.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more than five months before the primary election rivalry most elected Democrats say it is too early to talk about ers-what they have determined with the candidate who will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clinton supporters are more confident in his choice, rather than support ering other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost the support of some of the demographic groups, while Sanders has made some sort of bonuses.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has dwindled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders lags behind it by just 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">The preference for Clinton elected Democrats up to 50 years, disappeared, and ers-they are now on an equal footing with Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digit numbers among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of five points in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nearly half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they ers-enthusiastically would support Clinton if she became a candidate from the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support her just because she's a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six per cent would not have supported her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among those who are currently not supporting Clinton, her views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton ers-fewer voters, Republicans say the same about their leaders-era, Donald Trempe (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton supporters set an open question as to why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that now is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Also, Clinton supporters talk about an association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Also called agreed not on issues and chances of election.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because the vice president is contemplating potential participation in elections, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race ers-- though a third believe that he should not be.</seg>
<seg id="23">When asked whom they would like to see them in second place among candidates from the party, the primary voter Democrats in most cases called Biden's prodigy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would have chosen Biden second, it is more than that of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to present his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among participants in the race to 30 points without him.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton the candidate with the best shansers-in to win the general election; however, this figure has dropped from 78 percent in the past month.</seg>
<seg id="27">By this measure, Biden with a big lag in second place, but the percentage of those who considered him the most likely candidate, has increased.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, answering the question, what is most important in a candidate, elected Democrats choose other options besides the chance of being ers-elected.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similarly to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is not acceptable nominee for these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.</seg>
<seg id="31">The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden from all three leads on honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy ers-, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent don't have a certain opinion about him on this score.</seg>
<seg id="34">The primary voter Democrats also generally consider similar ideological views ers-Clinton, Sanders and Biden.</seg>
<seg id="35">By all these measures around a quarter of Democratic voters do not have any opinion about ers-Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email account and server during her Secretary of State have continued, a majority of Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation on this account and ers-believe that this has not had a negative impact on their overall opinion about it.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a completely different story from the American public in general.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but only about one-third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion about this split back in March, shortly after the story became known.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say that the controversy over the email did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who argue that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton considers fair and credible voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower compared to the previous month, and at 15 compared with May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters did not consider her honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump fair and credible.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks on the leadership qualities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the fraternity are accused in death of Baruch College freshman</seg>
<seg id="2">About two years later, after the death of a college student during a ritual initiation into a fraternity at Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania the murder charges against five people were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The members of the fraternity Pi Delta Pi from New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Denga during a ceremony in September 2013 and not taken him during initiation at the hospital, causing his death," the police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials say a student blindfolded and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times pushed while he was trying to reach a goal by going on a slippery surface.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psy did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited another hour before delivery to the hospital reportedly told police.</seg>
<seg id="7">They, however, found time to change Denga's clothes, found in Gugl symptoms and contact Andy Menga, national president of the fraternity, to ask the council, as police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal possessions, essentially putting the welfare of brotherhood above the health of Michael Denga," said chef Vagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">They were unable to save him and he died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report on the showdown, he received several blunt head injuries, Deng torso and hips.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have suffered as a result of a fraternity initiation ritual, since at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said in a statement, Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing the family of Deng.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members should be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">Jurors in Monroe County bent in favour of third-degree murder charges for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will receive the charge of violence against a newcomer and criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it all formally or informally, then," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College banned the fraternity, and nationwide fraternity excluded from its structure the local branch.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">The rate hike will happen, and "bull market" stumbles, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">That we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how much time will pass before the offensive, and how long it will continue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Specifically for the economy, there is little that explains the story about time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession came just 11 months after the first rate increase and by as much as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, the administration of the US Central Bank so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of an era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in his comments specialist for clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be seismic pulse, which many fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look at how some areas of the economy may react depending on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has already seen over the last month or so, anticipation of rate hikes could lead to instability for some time.</seg>
<seg id="16">When raising rates, however, the consequences are not typically dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The non-profits seem to share a brake on 12-24 months after the first jump and that, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="18">If more specifically, the market for the past roughly 35 years is more likely to dramatically change - about 14 percent toward rate hikes, remains fairly smooth over 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Dolle, chief specialist at Nuveen Asset Management Strategy Sales, published in Barron's stable.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and earnings from shares are starting to shrink.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often encourage them to play.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this case, the Federal Reserve has been in such conditions, which did not exist before and could precipitate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Basically, gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point ever increased rates.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, 118 cases increase in rates since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was ya below 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though it was 3.6 per cent during the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is for a long time, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed holds around.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants are preparing to raise Federal Reserve rates all year round, while their eyes riveted to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many experts on strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trade talks about only a 25-percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes until today were in the supercycle of increasing financial leverage in GDP, overlapping peaks, before recession, very quickly after we started their recovery," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle at the moment - the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the most recent recession; the record was 35 months, it only lasts for 74 months already and has not yet ended.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is somehow similar to that which is being implemented for the shares.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect will come faster for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes the strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">In case of bonds it seems that yields change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease of rates in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of rising rates, bond yields will immediately fall," Deutsche says.</seg>
<seg id="35">Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates would lead to the fact that levels of long-term and short-term bond yields will converge, making the curve more flat.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we are still dangerous in profitability," said Kathy Jones, fluctuations in fixed income research analyst at Schwab.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is interesting that Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been building towards the prospect of tighter monetary policy will," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, yield curve more flat, credit spreads widened, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when tightened policy of the Federal system.</seg>
<seg id="40">Speaking in general, companies in the United States, leading their main business, would benefit from rising interest rates and local production will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">International companies with lots of debt will be worse off, because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and their debt more expensive - in fiscal space.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that "quality" stocks demonstrate efficiency above market within three months after the initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with stable financial condition outperformed companies with unstable condition based on the results of each rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high yield capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better performance than shares of low quality, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.</seg>
<seg id="45">The debt is going to be a big question.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition to the purely exchange deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Depositors could also see profits through higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="4">Also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was simply a soda wound with Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">A colleague at Parliament Damien Collins, on The Voice with as much criticism, was not befallen original</seg>
<seg id="6">"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of members of parliament, prompting a broadcasting company to prove that she is doing anything that does not make commercial companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC's leadership that it seems as if the public radio station "foolish" and becomes less distinct from its commercial rival gets interesting.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems that it is turning into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also aiming to win the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you're trying to do something different - here are two examples that I first came to mind, in which you actually just copy what you already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director-general rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I find out thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And his devotion to live performances and creating music really doesn't match any more with anyone.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Also really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in search of new music and in promoting new works," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past, because Britons are less educated in classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Radio 3 was not the only brainchild of the BBC, which has suffered attacks for coming on heels of the commercial rivals during a hearing by a special committee of culture, media and sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">A member of parliament from Tori Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - a music talent show, which the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can see why this program has often been discussed in relation to the lack of originality and distinctive features?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall argues that the BBC 1 show, in which judges participate by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in a "typical BBC style."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants from the Corporation to "find the hit in his own home stables" the next time she won't be running a leisure project.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent future new seasons of The Voice, or use the money order who pays the license fee for other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Online sales growth slowed in August, and blame may be the best Black Friday</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015 there has been an increase in online sales by seven per cent</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month marked the slowest growth since it began to watch for in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help curb spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For about a decade, virtual shopping experiences a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Overall spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they began to pick up in 2000, increasing by just five per cent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are now signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase during the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at growth rates in previous years and return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian's Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales indices.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers were using their mobile phones to shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now it goes out on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, the number of buyers at five times the average rushed to computers in order to be able to take advantage of lucrative offers, thereby having struck a number of sellers' websites.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers come into a real fight over lucrative purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping</seg>
<seg id="18">According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">With regard to goods such as televisions and washing machines, then more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in fashionable shops in central streets.</seg>

<seg id="7">They say that Britons lay aside the hammers and painting and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to hand housing works in the house</seg>
<seg id="8">If you know how to handle a hammer or paint the walls, it seems that in our days catching you in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because, according to the owner of B & Q, Britons still hire professional artists to perform simple chall work at home.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronique Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of services for the construction of houses, said a substantial influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe stands behind this trend, offering services at minimal prices.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in products for masters, and at the same time close 60 stores of B & Q stores</seg>

<seg id="4">This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.</seg>

<seg id="11">Nine months ago, Greece was a budget surplus and growth prospects.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the country's fiscal deficit and high unemployment have once again.</seg>
<seg id="13">Investors were gone because Mr Tsipras chased them.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the past nine months, Greeks have had a chance to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and Mr Tsipras's false promises.</seg>
<seg id="15">And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.</seg>
<seg id="16">Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and it concerned the majority of Greek citizens.</seg>
<seg id="17">Euronews: but you say that in the event of an election victory will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZu.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vangelis Memarakis: the point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="19">And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where there were or still are rescue programmes, political forces and all ruling parties came together to implement a program on which they reached agreement without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">Euronews: your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.</seg>
<seg id="22">If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or try to change it, at least in part?</seg>
<seg id="23">Vangelis Memarakis: we actually voted for Greece's movement on the European path, because it is good to represent the country's exit from the EU, which would have caused devastating consequences.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker's package and assistance in the banking sector.</seg>
<seg id="25">All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the current austerity measures were a result of how Mr Tsipras has been negotiating.</seg>
<seg id="27">I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.</seg>
<seg id="28">Europe wants to help us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to impose order, acts rationally and makes clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am sure, all accepted commitments that cannot be fulfilled because lead to recession may again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">It would be a mistake to assume that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to the talks with our creditors as they await the full implementation of an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="31">If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatise, reform and structural changes that were agreed, continuing to benefit from EU funding and large investment opportunities, which we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, Tsipras's government has not submitted any serious arguments on many key policy issues that we've learned, discussing these issues with our European counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="33">I can cite an example related to the income of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="34">We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot fully be taxed in advance.</seg>
<seg id="35">We responded that Tsipras's ministers never talked about it.</seg>
<seg id="36">That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore poorly negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.</seg>
<seg id="37">Euronews: if you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.</seg>
<seg id="38">Will it be different from what you say, what you tell them your predecessor Antonis Samaras?</seg>
<seg id="39">Vangelis Memarakis: first of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying to accomplish the best deal in 2012, bypassing the sharp edges it existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">We pushed forward the reforms.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="42">The market had fallen and there was no potential buyers willing to pay the price, which satisfy the Greek government.</seg>
<seg id="43">I was speaker of parliament at that time, I was able to reconcile the opinions of three parliamentary groups comprising then a government majority.</seg>
<seg id="44">And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and it is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.</seg>
<seg id="45">And we were able to lead the country to a normal situation, which would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections, the result of December's presidential elections bottomless.</seg>
<seg id="46">Euronews: last week on the territory of Greece is moving the massive flow of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="47">What do you think about this situation and about the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?</seg>
<seg id="48">Vangelis Memarakis: the refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb, which we are going to have to deal with after winning the election.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the reason is that the SYRIZA government has not acted in this situation as they should.</seg>
<seg id="50">Such matters should act in a way forward, because if the problem catches up with you, only emergency measures remain.</seg>
<seg id="51">And we are now exactly in this situation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even the interim government, replaced within seven days, has made more than SYRIZu than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the republic, who called the EU summit, will find a solution to hold.</seg>
<seg id="54">We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is the victims of war in Syria, the victims of any extraordinary events that happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="56">This question has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.</seg>
<seg id="57">An appropriate decision must be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.</seg>
<seg id="58">We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.</seg>
<seg id="59">We also need to effectively use the economic aid that we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.</seg>
<seg id="60">Euronews: Mr Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.</seg>
<seg id="61">Vangelis Memarakis: thank you.</seg>

<seg id="6">He said: "Last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that the house has a "pösik," which "will not touch anybody," but probably upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police asked the name calling, but he has not named him.</seg>

<seg id="9">Having arrived at the scene, police discovered there body Amy Prentiss crime, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamba, 45, which said, "I'm sorry I would like to bring everything back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.</seg>
<seg id="11">Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, which killed Itana Schmidt, a teacher of history, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="12">University rector William Laforges said he was not aware of any conflict between Lambom and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamba clearly had something on his mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the information received on Monday about what had envisioned the novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, Lamb officials on Tuesday reported an "absence of any information or evidence" service "a love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">About Prentiss was recalled as a "good man" Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Luke Shaw from Manchester United was out for several months due to a double fracture</seg>
<seg id="2">Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the defender is experiencing on this occasion, because of which won't be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury occurred during a reckless sub-Hector Moreno in the 15th minute when sliding 20-year-old Shaw burst into the penalty area of PSV.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken away to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later in the day, and then will be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, has overcome great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then this happened.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was oxygen mask in the locker room.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was crying.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it is for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he will be able to play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and a penalty was not scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="14">Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish his Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal believes that an Italian judge had made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="16">Judge for yourselves, when I say that it's worth a penalty and a red card.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very ungood sub back with two legs.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his Twitter message, Shaw writes: "Thank you everyone for your words, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than it was."</seg>
<seg id="19">Still on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw in defeat in game with PSV</seg>
<seg id="20">British defender will have an additional incentive to improve for the championship in France next June.</seg>
<seg id="21">Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very heavy injury."</seg>
<seg id="22">When any player gets out with a similar injury, everything is very upset by this.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was never the intent of our players - to injure an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Galya at World Championships 2014</seg>
<seg id="25">"He is now very difficult because he had no intention of injure an opponent, and when you hear that it's a very heavy injury, then you feel unwell," Koka said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I had no opportunity to see the moment itself.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see is the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked as though he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see podkata under Luke.</seg>
<seg id="28">In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to move.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does David Cameron know about "Lorax" anything else?</seg>
<seg id="2">Every parent very quickly absorbs the one thing: if your child likes a book, there will be a bit of time before you will know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Answering a question about a representative of the company engaged in children's holiday vacation, his favorite childhood book organization, the prime minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental twist, written by Dr. Susz in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice," Cameron wrote in the comments, published on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "It's a hilarious, touching, unusual story with the strong message I love to read to their children, because it always reveals some image or message that we have omitted."</seg>
<seg id="6">And everything would be fine, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to transfer the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the movie of the same name, filmed in 2012, speaks with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original narrative.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the city, surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even useful Everythingville was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the air of Odri - the girl of his dreams, performing her heart desire - to see a real tree - "we read in the text a description of a love story, unknown Dr. Suzu (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">If that seems insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the film's plot, "Lorax" on the Internet Movie Database website: "In a place surrounded by high walls of the city, where everything was artificial and even useful Everythingville was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the air heart of Audrey - girls of their dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems unlikely that Cameron, though, admittedly, an active parent, not so familiar with the content of the book, in which an unnamed boy learns about how destroying the environment on behalf of the greedy felling of trees and an "all-right" viser ather, despite the protests of the Lorax ek (whose name Nakhodkins delivered in the title) is a funny creature with mustache, which "speaks on behalf of the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the performer, who had never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row the child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokesperson for Downing Street said that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Company SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but there was no further comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk of not getting into England, but it's still a complicated issue again</seg>
<seg id="2">The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates - not an easy task, but if you look at the England team for this tour, a repeat of that defeat in a test series seized with a score of 3-0, what happened last time, does not seem likely to me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would also have not ruled out winning on the field.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players who are among the players and virtuoso host Chers and collective thought strongly; these cool balls will not bear scars from 2012, but only a junior positive.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moen Ali turns into the bowler and Adil Rashid screached ball, even if he is an unknown figure for Test level attack below option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Still on the topic: Adam Leith was out of England's Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hiles circle</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to exclude Adam Lita to me, his main coach in "Yorkshire," of course, is difficult to analyze.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven Test matches have had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the brutal reality is that cricket players are assessed by judges according to results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no questions about John Rutu, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) the players best choose themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of half-long, and Lita could wait for more oten career, but he was in the grip of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">We hope that if he gets more Rans for "Yorkshire," there will be another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="12">England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, had good cheer about his mood, even when he did not show what he is capable of, and it does not surprise me; first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question, how much time will pass before the batsman of Test cricket will leave an impression of himself - a complicated issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lit played in seven games, as well as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton - in nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compton only got the chance to play on his own and on another field.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only thing on which you could complain is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">He appears, and Hayes batsman Scott, whom I appreciate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's an unpredictable cricket player, and what we have seen in the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge, something that was already set.</seg>
<seg id="19">He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">An idea to put Moeng near Kuok as an opening shift that would give an opportunity to introduce additional Batner, keeping four high-speed backchannels, considering, and I don't bow against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I see no reason why a player cannot hit the ball there, but this springing lefty has already shown that he is a fucking good cricket player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moen, perhaps not quite what was needed for his county Wustershire, but became the third number for them, and there is a big difference here.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches, "a third bethchange before opening out in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He won just three hundreds and never looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and during my conversations with him it seemed to me a very long unpromising young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at his approximate statistics - averaging 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and to think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little bit, and who chose to take the youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has a lot to learn from this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching structure.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayauswardine, shri-lankian bethchange, as a consultant for Test matches, could be the masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the best guys for the game, which brings to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide energy, as well as a ruthless pace in retape.</seg>
<seg id="32">I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, has a considerable intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they say something that has already been said before, can give new force to the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">Kohli's colleague Ben Stokes left the team at Durham, Rutu provided a similar break for one in connection with the island along with some, and I'm not, for example, Australia about this problem.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and individuals who select players do not determine the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions should never be taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Supporters of Britain's EU exit camp could win if the economy will be in recession by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's ill-considered policies on resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU every day are increasingly experiencing difficulties, even without looking at the election of a genius: "Is it yes or no?" - JeremCorbyn Labour leader or TUC resentment over Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Korbine and Nigela Faraji.</seg>
<seg id="4">A friendly European diplomat explained recently that when a situation in which the EU is currently experiencing a variety of crises, not all of them are of their own making - some member states fed up with British egocentric self-serving concessions and undermine the subpoena, which they disagreed mostly do not want to change.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that he doesn't want them anyway if they destroy social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it a "program selfi Dave and George."</seg>
<seg id="7">The prime minister and the finance minister are rolling around and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, to photograph themselves sessions on the backdrop of a famous local monument, local celebrities or without it, then come home and tell companies that they attract allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend who wants an interested in maintaining external contacts Britain under EU - "Don't leave us tent along with France," says Berlin - offers to say that ministers and officials in some capitals reached blinders by understanding when they would still remain, or we would leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is quite cautious, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave a cabinet before the situation gets worse for her, as she has deteriorated for the place of Thatcher (11 years) evruidered, Mitterrana (14) and Kolya (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">French President Francois Hollande faces overflight or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He, too, is losing strength.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is left.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hard to see them growing out of the skin, to help "selfie-razam," whose energy could be spent on shavers exit of Scotland from the UK - which they also do not want to avoid, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even plan the issuance of deliberately useless remarches in the style of the SNP during the referendum campaign in the UK in 2017, to spur the process of Britain's exit from the EU, suggests my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Revisited" and "Britain has not received a proportion of an obsession from the resumed negotiations "nothing valuable.</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans, for their trouble, know what a predator may be Fleet Street and how skeptical, and in relation to the EU, media tycoons are in contrast to the days of Tony Beny in 1975, which supported the launch of our membership in a 1973 referendum ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can dimly remember Boris Johnson, who celebrated his Euro opportunist for an inveterate "straight bananas" of the EU, Brussels correspondent in the early nineties.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all its stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included a colorful company of feared tax swindlers, phone hackers of outsiders and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair was absolutely the same opinion about them, but was aware that when you are put in a cage with lush gorilla, you must give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Milliband was greater than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's devotee about the referendum because Blair was acting normally in favor of the EU constitution that cancelled the principles of Blair recently buried French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press had not forgiven him anything from this.</seg>
<seg id="24">But milyga Jeremy Corbyn, who has friendly pat me on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer has time to spend it on me - appears to be at risk of repeating the strategy of Nile Kinnock "boycotting Merdoku" from the 1980s - an error and then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of engagement with the press - not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolutionment.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, most people outside the trainealist tendency of UKIP and a broader range of "diocsupporters of small England" among the Tories could probably say on this "yes."</seg>
<seg id="29">It is the same thing that Hilary- "Benn, but not the magnet" -Benn said on the radio and TV couple this week, while his inner Boy Scout struggled to admit that the appointment of Corbyn unrefused John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister wore was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for wick disloyalty to colleagues in the Labor Cabinet, without going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's battle was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" is the phrase that Benna is not what McDonnell said, nor does it pay for J. K. spoke to ram and members of parliament at a private meeting Monday evening, universal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Neither wanted to tell a Democrat and "his guy there," Korbin - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour TV seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is reasonable not to give Cameron so just to separate from Europe, allowing him to take for granted Labour support during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell's and Corbyn's main misconception about EU membership - as part of the "Sunni" economy of besieged fortress - is no longer an enquestion of esoteric discussions among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism generated by insignificant difference is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As for his delusions about NATO - Tom Watson unyielding that J.C. would not be to agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to bring this to their leaders at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why Paris or Berlin to spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions, when it can all be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already very disappointed with weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government of the Tories in power cuts back on spending than I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a non-forum called British Influence Security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts have criticized the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England</seg>
<seg id="2">The government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking, came at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts, published in British Medical Journal (BMJ), who together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic Cigaretthere.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE has published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have questioned the authenticity of the data and pointed to the connection between some experts with the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized "an extremely shaky argument," on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a BMJ article, another two researchers asked whether these claims are "solid or poorly founded." under a sweet</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Cowell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Pei University, said: "The fundamental principle of health at Liverpool is the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects the PHE claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are around 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, it is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model to multikritseries analysis of decision-making to sum up their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotine containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication axle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Makki and Kpvell reported that one of the sponsors of meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously reported that the Director General reported he had received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also confirmed BAT certificates for health in the report on sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id="13">One in 12 people at the meeting announced the funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not mentioning about funding, which he reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.</seg>
<seg id="14">A reasonable explanation for the choice of board members was not granted, but among them there are several prominent supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which also announced funding for the industry publication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have management experience in tobacco case.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting also visited the head of tobacco fields in PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The scientific article, published by the group, "agrees with the fact that there is a lack of "delicately "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Keïvell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links and restrictions have not been affected by the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">Makki and Kaipvell told PHE statements that "at present there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoking," are premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dr Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, told the BMJ that the answers were previously given statements.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One of the two who smoked all his life had died from his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence implies that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to explore distant consequences.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has had a clear duty to inform the public about what they show and what evidence does not prove, especially where there were doubts about the relative dangers of tobacco compared with the public.</seg>
<seg id="25">About 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is clear that although e-cigarettes are safe and are not closely identified, they are only a fraction of the harm done by smoking - we carry out our tasks in front of the nation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Channel 4 chief believes the BBC should stop the EastEnders episode</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give much for such successful shows as soap opera about "Albert Square."</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only for the creation of such programs, which are not produced by other British TV and radio companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for the fact that the company puts the transfer of public broadcasting, which certainly looks only a small portion of the audience, at peak airtime when competitors are going to have a show with high approval ratings and channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson remarked that he had in his time for six years unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with the BBC while working for Channel 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts transfers that could show rival companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of clarifying the future fate of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you save the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should be left on the air only those programs that are not produced and not going to be produced by other companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Show The Voice broadcast in prime-slot because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else doesn't show it, ridiculous and obviously absurd.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go on funding for programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are of their own production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other channels would undoubtedly have given much for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't understand how this could be a public broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think it would somehow minimize the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="15">The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed the channel Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC in pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to win support for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments about the BBC's most popular shows resonate with comments by Sky executive director Tony Bolla, who in his memory of MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested the BBC sell serials such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson noted that the more niche transmission of BBC public character "continue to go on BBC4, where often you can't gauge the audience, but the function of the company performed, and this can be charged as an argument in sanctimonious sermons, justifying revenue from licensing fees to 4 billion pounds: "Well yeah, of course, we do all these obscure transfers that no one is looking."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in the slot, where no one ever will be watching them.</seg>
<seg id="19">Johnson told the committee about the license fee as follows: "I urge you to find a more regression system with regard to who most parents will receive from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge amount, but for people for whom £150 is big money, I wonder, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former executive director of channels Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "informed, enlightened and party kai." i say.</seg>
<seg id="22">He noted that only a small portion of the material produced by the BBC is now formally classified as educational - in his words, it is 1% of TV content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should catch the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "informed, enlightened and party aikai." th.</seg>
<seg id="23">On matters of partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Promenadnye concerts" (only some of them, he says, is shown on TV), as well as to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Sonogenetics" allows you to manage your brain cells using sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have made worms with genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using ispulsa sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tiny nematodes are changing the direction of movement at the moment when they affect sound impulses, too high, so that the human ear could hear them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Impulses have effects by activating neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Still on the topic: researchers control brain activity using light</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetics," the essence of which is the use of ultrasound for the initiation of certain brain cells, heart and muscle, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, in La Jolla, Calif., told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the person's brain to send electrical impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chervi-nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He found that the bubbles reinforce ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "ion channels TRP-4," discovered in membranes blocks of certain cells of worms.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ultrasound waves are forcing these ion channels to open and tempt the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create a nematode that can be controlled via ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channel TRP-4.</seg>
<seg id="14">While using ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves reinforced microscopic bubbles and were introduced to organisms worms, activating modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">This method is similar to that which is applied in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to enable or disable neurons using light pulses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chalasani argues that in comparison with this methodology sonogenetics may have some advantages.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to the light, which is delivered to the desired brain area by fiber optics, low frequency ultrasound waves freely pass through the body's tissues, so no need to go inside the skull in order to deliver them.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can at times make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signal," said Chalasani ковому.</seg>
<seg id="19">He added that, in addition, the method can be applied to muscular and insulin-producing cells forming ru.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories</seg>
<seg id="2">Already 11 years have passed since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall strained smiles of those who I was irritated - and numerous, lengthy complaints on others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Basically what I learned can be spread across eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving into a hostel can range from slightly acting on nerves to absolutely terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">He encourages chat: telling people where you are, whether you're an academic holiday and where it had held, do you support Corbyn and why do you "honestly neither love nor hate" Marmayt, "because, seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll have myself."</seg>
<seg id="6">Peredochny.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others to rest too - ask questions and demonstrate fresh interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It supports conversation and helps you find people that you like, rather than those with whom you wouldn't even talk, even if you have eyelashes, they would have handed out alight and fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Give people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rooms of people often turn into drinking establishments, semi-night cinemas and places of common people, but they are also the place where people go and dress up and improve their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still on the topic: don't even think to begin studies at university, being in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">There are unfair to introveron universities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a haven, but many hostels are shaping the culture from one room to another, which promotes friendship, rickety of communication and leads to a long friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">It could be hell for someone who is trying to regain power.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in culture allows you to say: "You don't like me, and I want to keep up with you, but I need you to leave friends and I was able to restore the power that I spent to communicate with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when a co-worker is tired of communicating and not to knock students to him, but to send an SMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way, about the tie: do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw something.</seg>
<seg id="20">And make friends with the help of baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because you start university life at the height of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and highlight the plate of chocolate biscuits, is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbours, I give you something baked and now smile, explore and I will ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you and that, in the end, probably your face will be associated with their pleasant surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, it depends on whether you're a good baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bad tear lumps of flour, sugar and fat is more likely to cause captive people to pretend to be asleep when you'll knock them off.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, assigning someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft - take a bit of milk for tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Inquire the owner of milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most likely he will offer you not to be shy, even if inside boiling with anger.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize - but you try to take it older than my neighbor, who poured into his milk fluid for washing dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You don't need to produce noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the very people from saying about glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to kill the sound of drums and bass guitar, as was a3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam this morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">In response, a neighbor increased the volume.</seg>
<seg id="36">When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut her music and locked her door behind him, having gone on a three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was not romantic, if your future spouse had settled in the same dormitory as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">Instead, it would not be very much, until a piece of elbows, awkward, if you took the neighbor for his future wife, was fascinated by him, broke relations and would see him every day, and perhaps watch as he moves his side up on all your mutual friends turning?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, you cannot dictate your heart - but if a hot neighbour is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool its own fervor slightly.</seg>
<seg id="40">In that thrilling moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their locked room, the line between drawing and travley thinner than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good draw - it's fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach a valuable and interesting lesson on security, hiding something - say but never pack anything toothpaste and shampoo room chkaho.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock the door and drop the keys in someone else's glass of water, which you will then put in freezer - but do not adhere to other things glue Tack waj ceiling more than two Blu-times.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by logging into the app settings, select General and then "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have faced problems after installing when you receive an error message saying that they failed to "update applications."</seg>
<seg id="5">To avoid this, users are encouraged to either wait until they've revived or try to upgrade via iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process until the end.</seg>
<seg id="7">The process may include removing applications for an increase in free space - but Apple has minimised the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also has simplified the execution with a special utility that proposes to remove the app and re-install them again after completing the process.</seg>
<seg id="8">We should make sure that when upgrading your phone is charged or located near the charger to prevent battery discharge.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone discharging in the process can cause crash updates.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="4">About this "Izvestia" said Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev following a trip to Crimea commissioned a number of agencies -- the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Foreign Ministry, EMERCOM, FSB transport, FCS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and content of the yachts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The owners prefer to keep their ships overseas - approximately €200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russia's Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to List of Goods, temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from paying customs duties, taxes, "involving the provision of full conditional exemption from paying customs duties, taxes in relation to imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sport.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country," Lashkin said.</seg>
<seg id="10">This issue has been tabled for consideration by the subcommittee on customs, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade financing cost of a Government Commission on economic development and integration, which the meeting took place in September, and was also approved by authorities following the results of the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Development has noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release at import is inherently benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the government commission meeting in the Russian Federation Ministry of Economic Development will make an offer for the Eurasian Economic Commission discussion with states - members of ENPP, explained Lashkin.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for application in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism to provide international aid and others - service equipment (personal computers, among them typewriters), control and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious ceremonies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The press service of the Ministry of Transport of Russian Federation told Izvestia that prepared mandatory regulations" on sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide a simplified procedure for processing the setting and exit small-size, sports sailing and pleasure boats at sea port.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Ministry of Transport are given orders to provide capital of maritime ports of Crimea using simplified approach for small-size, sports sailing and pleasure boats at sea port and release of these ships from the sea port.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft regulations of the Russian government on approving the borders of Crimea port area.</seg>
<seg id="17">In respect of Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been taken, the rest are in the process of reconciliation," said the press service of the department.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Ministry of Transport, state surveillance, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes must carry out the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem is that it is extremely difficult to yachting in Russia due to poor infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is an ever-evolving industry, in which a large number of people are involved.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Russia, virtually all stands on the same spot.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our coastline uninteresting, the only piece where it is possible to operate a yacht year-round is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk and Anapa.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the big difficulty is that this area is extremely strict rules of border service: in order to get a walk on a yacht, you need to make a lot of permits.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, inside Russia, a yacht where not even a pit-stop.</seg>
<seg id="25">For two days, she can go with his fuel, and then the problem arises where his take," says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.</seg>
<seg id="26">As far as storage places, the yachts in Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 metres, and also yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Germany.</seg>
<seg id="27">Novikov said that the buyers of the yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has declined.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prisons are asked to create separate units for transgender people.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the Public Council at the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) to protect the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in colonies separate blocks for transgender and transvestites.</seg>
<seg id="3">About this "Izvestia." said a member of the board of Vladislav Grib</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia undecided on the floor, domestic prisons may include individual cameras, blocks or even (if there will be many such criminals) in perspective to create a special colony for transsexuals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Vladislav Grib stresses that determining the punishment of citizens in such an isolated place of departure is possible only after the convicts will go through the appropriate medical expertise, which prove that the perpetrator is truly a man who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite gender.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vladislav Grib believes that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in a pre-trial detention centre (where the accused are before the court's decision) provided separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today it is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Clearly we need to isolate them, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Humiliations are guaranteed by cellmates," says Vladislav trs Grib.</seg>
<seg id="11">Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with uncertain floor, you need and count where they are distributed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detention centers are not needed precisely - only cameras, separate blocks in prisons.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yes, a separate colony is possible if transgender people will be a lot.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Grib explained, in the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if the specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then the punishment for transgender prisoners can come there from all regions of departure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Citizens are kept in pre-trial detention at the place of the crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects in the course of the investigation and judicial process are unrealistic, but to introduce such practices for prisoners already in a separate colony - yes," says Grib.</seg>
<seg id="16">It should be reminded that before law enforcement officers were unable to decide in which the detention facility - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug possession of 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozukova (known as Alina Davis), because of what a man with a maiden appearance was not arrested.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was released home under a subscription of non-departure.</seg>
<seg id="18">This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, because the mechanism for transgender people in detention and prison colonies Rosie really does not exist yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places to serve a sentence for transgender people, noting that overseas it is also possible to define - male or female - depending on their own desire of the colony.</seg>
<seg id="20">Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals," says Alexeyev.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as they are in prisons more than transgender people.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, Alexeev doubts that Russia will find itself a lot of citizens who are willing to give themselves over to transexual people in order to get into an excellent council from ordinary colony.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in the colony for transgender people, but everything is not always clear.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, in the US, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning looked like a man and was already in jail, said he wanted to change the floor, Alexeyev said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A person can feel anyone.</seg>
<seg id="27">But while some places to serve penalties for transgender people, I have no doubt that prison staff will be thinking seriously about the safety of such people and empathize with their orientation or gender identification details.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender offenders in the colony could severely delay the early departure of al-punishment convicts.</seg>
<seg id="29">The commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists hold lengthy observations, this is not a single test, which is done on the basis of high-precision conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today's opportunities for psychiatry allow this.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, and before the change of gender, potential patients undergo always such expertise - they show exactly whether a change of gender with surgical intervention is a necessary measure," said Lordkipanidze.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system is implemented in relation to the condemned, because on average for such examination takes a month.</seg>
<seg id="33">The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that support in the current economic conditions will be appropriate to allocate funds for construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgender units in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but given that gay people in Russia are around 5%, it is possible to say that transgender people even less, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes, and even small numbers," said Lordkipanidze altogether.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now, at the request of the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgender and so before can obtain separate conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">The comfortable rate for the investment loan is 10-13%.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year was asking for 40%.</seg>
<seg id="3">What do you estimate the situation today?</seg>
<seg id="4">Panic after the end of 2014 and early 2015, SME lending volumes have declined significantly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="7">If previously the bank could lay in an increased rate of all its possible problems in the future, it is impossible to make the overdue payments to non-returns: bets and so sky-high.</seg>
<seg id="8">For business, the current level of rates on SME loans is not comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.</seg>
<seg id="10">The level of rates in 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.</seg>
<seg id="11">How do you estimate the demand for business loans is satisfied?</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation has improved slightly after the Central Bank lowering interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Credit resources have become more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to our observations, customers began to ask for loans much less frequently.</seg>
<seg id="15">First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today, businesses have one way out: we need to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.</seg>
<seg id="17">We need to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of cash.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, if they have the financial resources to use new technologies that allow us to modernize equipment, reduce costs and energy supply costs.</seg>
<seg id="19">All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep businesses even in an unstable economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the key market trends and will affect the development of its SME lending would be strengthened by the end of 2015?</seg>
<seg id="21">Will the interest rate change?</seg>
<seg id="22">The forecast for lower average rates will largely depend on the central bank's policies, and now the regulator shows the sequence in question of lowering the key rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the radical drop in loan prices for SMEs should not wait.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the current situation, the problem is, first of all, inflation, which makes the necessary increased interest rates to obtain real income.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the Central Bank lowering rates.</seg>
<seg id="26">Speaking about the level of delay, the company has traditionally been limited to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as opportunities to replenish funds and options for correction of economic behavior, certainly will pose a greater risk to lenders.</seg>
<seg id="27">I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.</seg>
<seg id="28">The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx revenue is mixed, lower forecasts for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx has reported on the results of the last quarter, and giant service delivery damworking reduced its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time last year, FedEx reported that they'd hire 50,000 temporary employees for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its shares were cheap at about 2.5 per cent on preliminary bidding for 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower forecast is seen despite rising rates by an average of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on January 4, and increase fees for ground transportation of heavy or overall cargo, which begins in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said they still plan to increase revenues compared to last year thanks to spending cuts, increased gross income and the growth of online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">Hiring plans for the holidays were announced the day after the rival workforce, UPS, claims that they plan to hire an additional 95 000 employees, roughly as much as took the job last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the year before.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share stood at $2.42, close to the forecast average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed, Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has suffered in recent years from the downturn in the sector of urgent international transportation, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express shipping division.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation grew by 29 per cent, but operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs for large departures and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Express transportation division received higher revenue because of higher benchmark rates, while the freight sector revenue fell due to rising labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In preliminary trading about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange FedEx fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They closed Tuesday, falling 11 per cent for the year and 17 per cent below the record from June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">The most anticipated meeting of Federal Reserve officials for several years will spend two days at this week's 27 feet from the Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether it was time to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">At one end of the richly decorated room for meetings high in two floors above them will be the United States" wall image overhanging out.</seg>
<seg id="3">This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues need to put the country's economic interests above all others.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank received a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment and keep prices stable here in the US.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Federal System executives have acknowledged that there is a third, unmentioned assignment: financial stability apis.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-predicted decision, which will be announced on Thursday, with about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecendent stimulus provided almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may keep the Federal system's already cautious managers from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even just over a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself triggers financial market fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Roughly half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg had forecast rising interest rates this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, expect that the Fed will hold off, while a key indicator shows only about a 30-percent chance of rapid rise.</seg>
<seg id="13">This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, assuming that those who make decisions do not soften the blow of a promise that the next increase will be non-core.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rise was driven by expectations that the faces that define the strategy of the Federal system will leave a bet this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There will be a surprise if the Fed will raise rates at this point in time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the Federal Reserve's guidance goes so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they are not panforged."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only a month ago, the Fed appears to have tended to raise rates by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slow tightened financial conditions that could women confirm the strength of the US recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen claimed in the spring and early summer that she expects to raise rates this year, despite complaints from liberals about what greater economic progress is needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, labor market growth has been steady this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to the level at which the Federal system considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.</seg>
<seg id="24">And, while inflation continues to be below the target annual rate of 2%, the central bank said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp Federal leadership system of falling oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, financial markets around the world became a shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% relative to a record high in May, value companies, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market partly regained its position this month, and the Dow is now about 10% below the high May values.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Federal Reserve's guidance the market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks they would have started tightening the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicted, they will have to wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a big uncertainty in what might be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not included in the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="34">But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a world financial power.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">One only hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "stifle" its monetary expansion, sparked market turmoil around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, one might expect that Federal Reserve officials will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and with experts to better understand the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making process is "art rather than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet, Inc - a company which deals with global wealth management strategies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said earlier this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve, there were cases of over-reaction on financial market movements, which does not seem to be related to economic principles."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a member of the powerful Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote on raising rates as an example, who pressed 1998-99 led solutions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The financial crisis in Asia has led to the fact that the Fed has reduced its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent over three sessions, "despite limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the heads of the Federal system abolished these declines.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Federal Reserve should put on top concern about stability only in times of major crises, such as how the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee for setting interest rates at the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest panic and close did not come close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You would, of course, don't want to end up in a situation where you fear rising rates because markets are experiencing shock," said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, as long as this does not change, I do not think that they should be ahead of the event.</seg>

<seg id="6">Assad drew attention to a sharp U-turn from the Western media since the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power by undemocratic, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."</seg>
<seg id="8">Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="9">Commenting on the West's persistent claims that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if it goes away - at the request of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva conference or the Geneva communiqué.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If the people want him to remain - the president remains, but otherwise he should depart immediately," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Assad has called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is carried out with them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighboring Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.</seg>
<seg id="14">He refuted claims that Iranian military units will be sent to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">As for the other states, then we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist coalition and anti-igilovo US-led "said Assad.</seg>
<seg id="19">The death toll has exceeded 230,000, the number of refugees - 11,5 million.</seg>

<seg id="8">Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will take place October in Korea, and then I will think about the rest.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is true that I will be prepared at home, in Barnaul, and now at home - it is still quite another condition.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is easier than every week to motor around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">You once said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.</seg>
<seg id="12">The end of August, beginning of September is a great time.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the main start of the season, passions were not given away; burden of responsibility is already halfway up</seg>
<seg id="14">We can compete in the pleasure, on "relax."</seg>
<seg id="15">Plus you know what and leave very soon...</seg>
<seg id="16">But fatigue is?</seg>
<seg id="17">Still the season special, lots of positive emotions...</seg>
<seg id="18">Fatigue towards the end of the season always accumulates.</seg>
<seg id="19">And then it doesn't matter that I did more - won or lost.</seg>
<seg id="20">Every competition is stress.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frequent flights, overriding - all this does not pass for the body without trace.</seg>
<seg id="22">Tired physically and emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="23">But now the emotions I have, of course, is on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm just happy there - yes!</seg>
<seg id="25">By the time the World Cup was finished in Beijing, return often?</seg>
<seg id="26">It happens.</seg>
<seg id="27">Oh, and you journalists, don't give me to forget about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">But in general I think that bad sportsman who lives the old victories, scrolls their successful races over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ponaslai was waiting a couple of days to win - we've got to move on.</seg>
<seg id="30">Preparing for this remarkable season was very different from the usual?</seg>
<seg id="31">I can't say that there was something special.</seg>
<seg id="32">We started preparing as early as December, but winter competitive season I missed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">All as usual.</seg>
<seg id="35">But with the coach set a task: to try to reach a new level on which I have not yet been.</seg>
<seg id="36">Almost all winter spent to lay the base.</seg>
<seg id="37">They ran a lot of cross races, having been doing exercises on commonnaysic preparation, which included both traction and effed, and the back we've shook lowered.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then he went for barrier training, did a lot of technique.</seg>
<seg id="39">For how are rivals, monitored?</seg>
<seg id="40">I always try to do that, good in the Internet age with this there is no problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">They looked at the winter European Championship and all the pedestal was taken over by the French Barrier Sprint!</seg>
<seg id="42">Thought another: you need to do something, to dilute this company.</seg>
<seg id="43">With every start this season you have added and added second in the results.</seg>
<seg id="44">It gave confidence?</seg>
<seg id="45">I have all the latest seasons fold on roughly the same scheme.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then - 13.50.</seg>
<seg id="47">I always unwinding its shape gradually.</seg>
<seg id="48">The main thing that we wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="49">The whole work was aimed primarily at this result.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the paradox is that the kind of feeling that is ready for feats, and to show their readiness does not always get the competition.</seg>
<seg id="51">As it was, for example, at the London Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="52">I am, to be honest, the semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. "NI") tried to forget at once.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was very good, really could run out of Ready's 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Yes, even if repeated his best result at that moment would be the bronze winner of the Games.</seg>
<seg id="55">But unlucky.</seg>
<seg id="56">Their first World Cup remember?</seg>
<seg id="57">And how?</seg>
<seg id="58">In Taigu it was.</seg>
<seg id="59">I really wanted to climb into the final, then there was such a maximum plan.</seg>
<seg id="60">And then came straight from the preliminary races and recutalach.</seg>
<seg id="61">And then I realized that to tear and break his head would have nowhere to flee at all ascend.</seg>
<seg id="62">Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, having already reached the final with the best time.</seg>
<seg id="63">Well I remember my feelings before the decisive races: very much wanted to win "gold" already!</seg>
<seg id="64">How can a decent speed, and not lose another head without building shut down?</seg>
<seg id="65">But this is the most difficult.</seg>
<seg id="66">You need to be very careful, focused on technique, not to knock down barriers.</seg>
<seg id="67">I noticed that when you set yourself up, not the result, but the process is so much easier.</seg>
<seg id="68">But you have the most buzz when you get the feeling that you run and everything looks like itself!</seg>
<seg id="69">Honestly, it's worth it.</seg>
<seg id="70">Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious success tend to move closer to the capital.</seg>
<seg id="71">Never had such thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="72">Houses are still better.</seg>
<seg id="73">And I have no idea where I am without my trainer, who needs?</seg>
<seg id="74">Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.</seg>
<seg id="75">C Klevtsov you've been together?</seg>
<seg id="76">With 12 years since the athletics came to light.</seg>
<seg id="77">More precisely, at first I was training at his wife, who worked with the children, and then she gave me.</seg>
<seg id="78">I started with sprint, then jumped, triple in length.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was when the ball was throwing their baby all-around in length from place jump...</seg>
<seg id="80">At 14 I tried running with barriers and I liked that.</seg>
<seg id="81">From the very first race managed to execute the second adult discharge rule.</seg>
<seg id="82">And so remained.</seg>
<seg id="83">Fear of the barriers was never?</seg>
<seg id="84">Somehow managed to agree with them immediately.</seg>
<seg id="85">But over the technology have always had to work very much.</seg>
<seg id="86">Won over one overclocking how much was suffering!</seg>
<seg id="87">But from this routine is nowhere to run.</seg>
<seg id="88">I could always need honing technique - to wake up at night, I'd just stood up and ran through the barriers.</seg>
<seg id="89">Everyone who saw your race in Beijing, argued that it was a very beautiful run.</seg>
<seg id="90">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="91">I also liked myself.</seg>
<seg id="92">Normally I don't revise my races here, but could not help.</seg>
<seg id="93">But we need to work further on efficiency - no limits of perfection.</seg>
<seg id="94">Not afraid now that the victory of the year before the Olympics will fall on the shoulders of heavy load?</seg>
<seg id="95">As they say in such cases, I would try to justify expectations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Once chose this road, then must go to the end.</seg>
<seg id="97">My coach likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional cargo should not feel ac.</seg>
<seg id="98">And I absolutely agree with him in this.</seg>

<seg id="10">Jarrid Hain lost the ball to return Pant's "Minnesota Vikings" team during the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="11">At this start of his debut in the NHL Hain and numerous Australian fans clearly didn't count.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was evident as Hain curses, walking away from the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unfortunate start to a career in the NFL.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This happens, you just think about the next game and everything," Hain said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hain likened his misses with a series of games debut in 2007, when the throw of the ball in his Origin zone brought Queensland try off-set.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ultimately the experience proved to be quite useful for the 27-year-old player.</seg>

<seg id="2">Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the beginning of a campaign of doubling donations intended to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping flood European countries refugees who flee from war-torn and who impoverished countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing campaign collecting donations in his blog.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead of a statement made one of the executives, a Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with his family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We traveled on dubious trains and buses, tolerate hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was lucky.</seg>
<seg id="7">But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, plenty of people such as my family desperately need help.</seg>
<seg id="8">Donations will be given to four nonprofit organizations engaged in assistance to refugees and migrants: "Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, an organization Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Google said that it would be doubling the first $5.5 million in donations, as long as the amount does not reach the $11 million page of google.com/refugeerelief.</seg>

<seg id="1">Diabetics with little obesity could help obesity surgery</seg>
<seg id="2">A favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with little obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years suffering, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it is still early to assert that diabetics are living longer after obesity surgery with little than those who receive non-surgical treatment of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality statistics are not immediately evident," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in JAMA Surgery editor's column.</seg>
<seg id="5">Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the organization to absorb food patterns.</seg>
<seg id="7">For several years, bariatric surgery has proved to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, but the basic research was carried out among people with morbid obesity (BMI), which became a BMI of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or above suggests that a person's excess weight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered people with obesity.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from the Taiwanese hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007, to compare the two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy lab, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with little obesity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI of those who had undergone surgery fell from 31 to 24.5, by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, IMT in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes, remains at about 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who underwent surgery were completely cured of diabetes by 36%, and partially - 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the group that had received medical treatment, for comparison, there was only 1% complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2 per cent have had a partial.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, rates of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin levels in the blood, which reflect on blood sugar А1in dynamics.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7%," the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the therapeutic group, however, he remained stable, at around 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the best indicators of glycaemic control, reflected good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced mortality rates for five years, according to the head of research by Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results of two types of surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For the fifth year, in comparison with the group, which has a half-sleeve gastrectomy, the band chunting lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.s2 kg), has achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin (3.1% vs. 2.1%), as well as А1was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgical technique in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from research on overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine at the University of Phoenix, Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who have chosen bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower compared with the group in which more traditional methods were applied.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study found no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it was reassuring people with a BMI below 35, interested in such a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The report is very important here, because it argues that such surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to seriously treat the weight as soon as a patient's BMI falls into the range between between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we are waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">It seems to me that as soon as they will accumulate genetic changes that run into their bodies of obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn back.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.</seg>
<seg id="2">Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to place themselves among tourists who come to watch the World Cup in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other hotels are still in no hurry to receive the appropriate permission.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the run-up to the world championships, the authorities urgently need to invent how to spread out all the guests of the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rosbalt" interlocutors believe that the cost of renting apartments will grow by 10-30% because of the tournament, with removable and removable housing will have to pay for after the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="7">The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.</seg>
<seg id="8">By law, written specifically for primacy, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo classification procedure and prove that corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is already clear that it will not be able to do everything: hoteliers are so wary of checks, which are often not even sending documents to requests by the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov said, the department has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases with regard to hotels, many of which have simply not responded to antitrust.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies lied citizens, placing a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The problem is that the account is now literally every single room, you can't lose in front of the 2018 year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms in the city.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel - 100 - two- and three-star, 550 one-star.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gwichie, at this point, only 23 hotels took place - so many inspections carried out accredited classification company in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">But whether a similar procedure for regional enterprises has ordered, Smollocated by an amazing coincidence is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="18">There may be more, but none of the past classification doesn't know about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Over the past six months, hotels have not really sought to undergo classification" - acknowledged the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is explained by the high season, during which hoteliers earn most of the money and do not want to do other things.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another reason is the budgets, which have not been laid in expenses for inspection, while the procedure can cost between 30 and 100 thousand rubles depending on the status of the hotel and more.</seg>
<seg id="22">But lately, managers of hotels have become activated and began to apply for classification assured Shadian.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hotels should be done before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also would not get the right to work for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="24">Already it is known that depending on the celebrity will be developed a fixed fee for a room at the hotel during the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="25">The formula, which will be calculated by the cost, are made public in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is done in order to prevent price hikes at 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.</seg>
<seg id="27">We need to have a conscience and to prevent the increase in two or three times, but also the hotels should be earned.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained Russian Hotel Association president Gennady Lamshin.</seg>
<seg id="29">Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixation corresponds to an understanding of the market economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">I don't know how this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It's better than rampant appreciation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is unclear what will happen to those popular cheap.</seg>
<seg id="33">Duma deputies introduced a bill under which hostels should be banned in residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="34">We hope that this law will not be accepted or will not affect St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="35">"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gachia said.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, she said, owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the Duma does approve the bill, it will close about 80 per cent of hostels in St. Petersburg, and currently there are 1.5 thousand rooms in them.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to the president of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers in Northwest Leonida Garbar, Petersburg lacks two and three star hotels, which both times and demand football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.</seg>
<seg id="39">This situation is analogous to the situation when "on a 80-thousand stadium 75 thousand vips sit."</seg>
<seg id="40">This can be corrected just at the expense of the mini-hotels.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their possible ban expert believes "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in flats, but for some reason the visitors cannot."</seg>
<seg id="42">If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="43">But if as a hotel in which guests come for a short time, then why not?</seg>
<seg id="44">Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup; and because of their slug</seg>
<seg id="45">Hundreds of small hotels are simply not having to undergo classification, complete with a pit digging themselves.</seg>
<seg id="46">By the summer of 2016 order works will be all the city's hotels.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will abandon less paid orders from mini-hotels, and choose the ones that will be destroyed," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that more money in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, is significantly higher than St Petersburg's currently passed inspection scores.</seg>
<seg id="48">The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected with permanent pieces in the tourist bloc including the government, which does not promote an re-united work.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels don't have enough, they will probably need to pay attention to all regional hotels and holiday homes.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example, in celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, guests will be able to mobilize the river fleet, i.e. the tournament cities may live in cabins.</seg>
<seg id="51">Besides, many fans prepare to come on wagons, which will be immediately possible to spend the night.</seg>
<seg id="52">"The important thing is not to set up so many hotels, then they remained empty," said Gennady Lamshin.</seg>
<seg id="53">Also very popular during the football championship will use removable housing.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most likely in the city would create a reserve of removable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.</seg>
<seg id="56">"From the obvious - the first to leave home near the stadium," said a specialist in rental property development and research agency Larisa Bragina.</seg>
<seg id="57">And the price of the lease may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.</seg>
<seg id="58">It will also contribute to the construction of new road junctions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.</seg>
<seg id="59">We should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not simply suggest a road, but they can also hold a mini-tour.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are also complications.</seg>
<seg id="62">My dad was in 1970, in the yard - father, mother and two children met a family from Murmansk.</seg>
<seg id="63">It turned out that there was no place to spend the night with hotels, then it is difficult at the station to sleep hard.</seg>
<seg id="64">"And Dad brought them into our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered the interlocutor.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, he added that there were currently no such features in the city's inhabitants - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.</seg>
<seg id="66">But perhaps in 2018 after unsuccessful Duma, hoteliers and governments decisions will have to remember past mistakes?</seg>

<seg id="2">With admiration today looked at Zhirinovsky's clowado in the State Duma.</seg>
<seg id="3">He did such things when our generation was still only learning to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The theme of the speech seems to be a protest against the election results in the Amur Region LDPR."</seg>
<seg id="5">Protocols are not shaking for nothing; other protocols, except apparently signed by elected LDPR, have no Communist.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here he raises took second place Ivan Abramova and shouting has something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"</seg>
<seg id="7">And then no why, then, is plunging into Rodnin after already taking the faction with presiding shouting matches from the chamber, screaming literally "you all with fronts your swindlers and thieves."</seg>
<seg id="8">The press, of course, gives the emphasis not on Abramova, but as a consequence of this scandal and abuse scandal and demarche faction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Realistically Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region along with Abramov.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the whole country it is another trick of the Zhirinovsky in style "Podrace!," rather than a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, if the faction has formally decided to believe the party and election candidate al-Feysbuku Ivan Abramova, the site has not recognized, but the leader with themes clearly makes a tear.</seg>
<seg id="12">Provides dead on Amure themselves to bury their dead, and itself is blessed with "United Russia" as a whole and not anything against forgiveness Rodnina.</seg>
<seg id="13">Elegant decision not to lose, and in the present, rather than face scandal not to go ostentatious.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is another matter that now appears in a strange situation and Abramov himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">But he did not see anything from bosses yelling at himself, there was no protocol of alternative hands.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for the narrow circle, it became a formal occasion and for insulting a respected champion, and that is still steep, hamian attacks against EP and ONF.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then, of course, he needs to think very seriously what to do.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because the main beneficiary of elections, policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 on the only regional single-mandate district could turn into a pariah, which had successfully enjoyed his own party leadership and super-irritant for the UNF and party leadership alien.</seg>
<seg id="19">There certainly wouldn't be Zhirinovsky, he might have come up with - and respectful for him to watch.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has yet to grow and grow to cling.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was also news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next film arches.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is why no bath has fallen at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">A fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed up the disinfectant for hands, for the last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Toxicological centers in the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years old, who had swallowed up the disinfectant for hands with high alcohol content, according to Georgia State Toxicology Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of pro-children up to 12 years of fluids for disinfection of hands glata reported to toxicological centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The children contact with these substances more frequently and, unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the emergency department," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He explained that some children drink a disinfecting liquid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or on an argument for social networks.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the YouTube videos, you can see how teenagers drink disinfecting liquid as a cheap drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenagers reportedly mixed disinfecting liquid with an alcohol-containing liquid to rinse the mouth in order to get a more potent drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">More younger children can attract a pleasant smell of disinfecting fluid.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the most attractive (disinfecting fluids for their hands) - those that are flavoring.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is a disinfectant liquid to hand with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">A disinfecting liquid for hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Young children, in particular, have only a handful of spray can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This spirt of high concentration," told Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr Stephen Thornton, Chief Physician of Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">You wouldn't just leave the glass with whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Naidge Russell, 6-year-old girl who recently at school swallowed the disinfectant for a hand with strawberry flavour in the amount of approximately four spray, was sent for treatment in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alcohol levels in her blood were 179, twice as much as an adult, which by law is considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to those of Dr. Chris Ritchie - a doctor who treated her emergency medical center in Gwinnett near Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naidge had words and could not walk when she was taken way to the ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury because because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head told Ritchie.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," told CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.</seg>
<seg id="21">It might well prove fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use unlocking substances or disinfectant napkins, located in addition of honor to remove disinfectant liquid would reach the hands of children.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids linked to the deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women from Ontario died after being swallowed up or disinfectant that contained a toxic undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a lethal agent rather than ethyl alcohol, which was specified as the current substance.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three students in the north of New York were a fourschooler of their "anti-poison" teacher conspiracy by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">A teacher has a strong allergy to disinfectors for hands, and she has forbidden to keep them in their class.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk," which will address issues of discipline and school districts.</seg>

<seg id="18">A little American girl wrote a book, and she was called "My Cancer mommy" - "my mother has cancer."</seg>
<seg id="19">Olya did illustrations, and thought: life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it, if you do not create them yourself..</seg>
<seg id="20">Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and composes herself tales.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is traditionally considered that children lose interest in the book that they increasingly live in some virtual space...</seg>
<seg id="22">But certain readers go to children and their parents understand signs reading," says Tatyana Kushkind. "Russian planet library director</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent years, we have even emerged that such a moment of confidence is needed, and it will be a children's library that children are going to live here! -</seg>
<seg id="24">I think the interest in reading is returning.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained with updated photographic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library are displayed by the whole family: mom, dad and children.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the library are rejoicing that children are increasingly coming to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="28">If in two years the child read only Chukovsky more senior age he needs books tricky.</seg>
<seg id="29">But now there is a law, under which eight years it has forbidden to issue books from category 12 + wunderkind.</seg>
<seg id="30">To receive such a book, the child must bring their parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something of a family club for them.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are treasures in the library with pre-revolutionary collection, epic, and lead by Korolenko gave an attachment to the magazine "Niva device," "Murzilka" undercover for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="32">After all, we are not only a conceptual space "temple, "now we are open to movement, we try to book a special place: not home, not work, not be a school," explains Tatyana Kushkind.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can come to us all together to read, play, draw.</seg>
<seg id="34">We have made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, but something still stretches to book! cro</seg>
<seg id="35">Some of our readers are parents, and they don't want to go, leaving legs falling.</seg>
<seg id="36">Often come mothers with strollers - and we are pleased that the library they put in first place among all the other places where you need to come with kids.</seg>
<seg id="37">Tatyana Kushlook says: modern kids just like we once, love classic children's literature:</seg>
<seg id="38">"Publishing is now developing, and much attention is paid to the authors, who are the link between generations."</seg>
<seg id="39">But if we are talking about small children, it is important that there was some kind of hero who races from one book to another traveling.</seg>
<seg id="40">Kids don't like to part with their heroes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which describes what is happening in modern children's literature, which books should pay attention to and why.</seg>
<seg id="42">The booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bear books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="44">This magic privilege is only for children.</seg>
<seg id="45">... In the most distant room of the library there is a square with an ancient wooden staircase into the basement door of the book safe seat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Steps will be considered under your steps - it's already a very old machine time crypto.</seg>
<seg id="47">With the book of his childhood you meet, as with an old friend: Hello, it is good that we do not change with you.</seg>
<seg id="48">Ellie is still having fun walking tall on the road, paved with yellow bricks, band Tolai Ryzhikov stealing my magic matches, while Malchish-Kibalchish never told the cursed burins Military Mystery - so he has a hard day word.</seg>
<seg id="49">Books such as passwords, you can find them anywhere on their own.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are in storage and real bookrarities - for example, pre-revolutionary collection epic with aties and ers.</seg>
<seg id="51">Or to lead Korolenko in the famous "Niva" magazine app.</seg>
<seg id="52">Or the "Murzilka" cover for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="53">Time has aged pages, has divided them into a tea break color.</seg>
<seg id="54">These publications are no longer issued to readers.</seg>
<seg id="55">These fragments of our future collection, I always dream - go out for retirement and take rare children's books. mush</seg>
<seg id="56">But the kids on it already, so to speak, will not tell: and paint in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now it seems: why did we all give this "PionPVC the truth?"</seg>
<seg id="58">But still it was interesting," said Galina Ilysova, "Russian world" Head of the book storage facilities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Murzilka" pages turned darker from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="60">Galina Vasilyevna is head of the book security Pole all his life.</seg>
<seg id="61">She knows what color cap Buratino, in which academic year Harry Potter has become the captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team at the championship, in what situations Carlson uses a dampener for motor, and who's the father of Alice Selezneva works.</seg>
<seg id="62">Librarian pay little for work, and anyone who can live without these bookranks very quickly find themselves another profession.</seg>
<seg id="63">Only the most convinced remain: enlighteners, teachers, ministers of cult book.</seg>
<seg id="64">You can find out more about them and smile - it is thought that this is a professional feature of children's librarian.</seg>
<seg id="65">If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation - it is a professional.</seg>
<seg id="66">I love children's books: how I like to be librarian for exactly and beautifully stood on the shelves, and I love to read them again," said Galina Vasilyevna.</seg>
<seg id="67">I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.</seg>
<seg id="68">Read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...</seg>
<seg id="69">Of course, it seems to me, in my childhood, everything was different.</seg>
<seg id="70">The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that was happening to me at that time.</seg>
<seg id="71">And because I loved them, it seemed to me that the library is a totally magical place.</seg>
<seg id="72">And I wanted to work there, where all sit and read.</seg>
<seg id="73">I hope the books will always, despite the rigors.</seg>
<seg id="74">And rejoice when our former readers lead children and even grandchildren...</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody blames stewards in attempted espionage and threatens to withdraw from equestrian sport</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards in an attempt to introduce a spy in his stables last year and threatened that immediately would leave horse racing.</seg>
<seg id="3">His targets were stewards and Racing Victoria integrity department officers, whom he blamed for the fact that they organized a campaign personally against him, and removal from the start of Lady Tatai because of violations of the rules on the use of drugs in a day starting on Wednesday became the latest burdens.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing all efforts by participating in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation, when we were talking about the positive result of Lidari's sample on cobalt, which he could not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He held his tongue on suspicion of espionage for about one and a half years and did not want it to "look like selen grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and for a long time, but sometimes you endured it so upset that you're no longer holding back," said Moody.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know that it has lasted.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences and I ships will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today I will go home and sleep tight.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk with his head held high, and I want my owners to know - I am doing everything possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they begin to think that this is not the case, then I will need to stop being a coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then I will have to think what to do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody sensationally claimed during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stables.</seg>
<seg id="14">"a year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man whom I call, if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to transmit information about what I'm doing in my stables," said Moody at Racingnot .com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They clearly believe that I am the fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If so, they should all certainly apply, as an attempt to catch them failed me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, CEO of RVL, knew about all this esnanny and now know now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shouldn't it make me think that the case has become personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Shouldn't the RVL gain courage and to bring to account for what is happening in this business, other people, apart from the coaches?</seg>
<seg id="20">Whether I am bad for this profession?</seg>
<seg id="21">So whether I'm bad for this profession?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people there think it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt - what I am saying now can make them think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But now I've got to the point where I don't care, and it saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="25">I am truly sad from this.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will continue to put pressure on them and they have the responsibility to make the decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of the family, and I can walk away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The coach only grew in the course of a long investigation of the annoyance with cobalt and Lidari, and the last case of a horse from the start made it clear that he would withdraw "throwing his license on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known by the fact that he has prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of competition "ridiculous" after the horse's leg was struck from clay, which is a violation of the rules compress.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a violation of rules on the races.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my employees mistakenly made her kompress on the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">She could get a compress yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">She could get him yesterday, as it was.</seg>
<seg id="35">She was with him on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules regarding the use of medical drugs in a day of competition for the use of compression, about which the stewards have opened an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's an anecdote.</seg>
<seg id="38">People creating these rules don't know anything about horses.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy will pair rivals' charges in applying tough security techniques</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of intercepting the ball his team" as "imposing the agenda" by the two NRL championship favorites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Rustlers coach Trent Robinson said the judges "allowed" "Storma" "fight" with his team during their final qualifying game in a sudden victory in Sydney at Storma on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has made clear on "The Storm" after his team Namok won the final qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Kauboz" on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and claimed that two of the Queensland teammates were not "too successful" in a melee fight.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended intercept the ball of his team and said they were simply focused on "touch," by intercepting the ball.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that he inspired confidence in his team's criticism by two leading coaches, because it means that they are worried about possible defeat from "Storm."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It continues to pop up - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson spoke about the tough sessions when they were taking us with a score of 24: 2 defeated," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I trust that we have not changed anything for a whole year in their systems or security techniques, just over the last six weeks we have paid particular attention to your contacts when the ball interception, and it was a turning point for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent there for three years and he obviously trains an excellent team, so he is probably not used to losing, and for him it was some shock.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how it always shows up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy did compete with Bennett's idea about "impressive football," reminding his teacher that "St George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennetta won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne says about exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and see how impressive was their game," Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010, "Saint George" many criticised, calling it a boring team, Wayne said that he didn't care.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can show what he considers to be an impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is football, which you would want to play when you have such players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such halfback Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they might as well play.</seg>

<seg id="2">The man, who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling, was released on bail $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the yacht Solay, travelling from South America via Vanuatu and moored in Kumere died in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Throughout the morning, Maksimovic and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the car Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite the fact that Maximovich faces a lifelong sentence for attempting to obtain narcotic substances in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole party, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should let go on bail.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latter has had ties with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He frequently travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">He lied to police about the location of his residence during the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother and stepfather Maximovich was asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The testimony of both becomes obvious that the amount of collateral of $200,000 is too great a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this measure is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was allowed to be free on bail on condition that he surrenders his Australian, as well as a Serbian passport, will be celebrated in police daily and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his one-club men should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb'</seg>
<seg id="2">In conversation with Wilshre Wenger also stressed that still only September, and what if the Wilshire recovery will go according to plan, then nothing would prevent his return to the game for Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under the most favourable developments Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hurt most in this recent issue that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with the only ankle injury and was going to return to the familiar aggressive style of play during pre-season training.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."</seg>
<seg id="6">It just was not until the end of the healing bone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nothing serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's just a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not connected with the ankle or the injuries that he had previously covered.</seg>
<seg id="10">It can be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, there is also a risk of additional injury for any player associated with that returning to play in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also the unfavorable trend.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Premier injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that have occurred with him for six years since his debut.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, he has played only 65 of the 157 games at Arsenal in the league over the past five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you look at the alignment for Arsenal, you may notice that in six of eight seasons, increasingly since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of two Premier League clubs, on account of which most missed due to injury days.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger admits the likelihood of "stuck in a vicious circle, but in Arsenale" believe that improving injury statistics in the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, returning after injury, you go online for a while - during this time you need to recover and get exposed," said Wenger with a competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough and will cope.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope that he will recover physically, I am sure in this, as well as the fact that his career will be such that he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal are starting to campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue its match in Saturday games with Chelsea and the following Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur," and Wenger intends to hold a team rotation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Belerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, therefore most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta.</seg>
<seg id="21">Perhaps Wenger will also introduce a member of Kirana Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to maintain a balance and give a small reprieve to those players who need it," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal absolute favourite in Group F, Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among the most devastating in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they have managed to spend last season as "Invincible."</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was 10th in Zagreb earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson received last season when the team was defeated in the Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the final of the Champions Cup.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">Arsenal have never done before.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realist with experience.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: a comedy show that has taught us serious lessons of male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of such stories catches the eye, especially when one considers how desperate the need of men in frankness has become more than ever now that the suicide rate among young men is at the maximum for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it became the single biggest cause of death of men aged between 20 and 45 years in the UK, and with men it happens three times more often than with women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an attempt to resolve the issue of "Campaign Against a miserable life," announced the 2015 Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study, more than 2,000 university students who have shown symptoms of depression, found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of cure are doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Similarly to those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends twice reduces the chance of mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, of course, that friendship worked, first and foremost, that she should be.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an era when communications are managed by social networks when style content, quick answers are often valued more than prefer meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality of loneliness reigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship that stronger influences our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, as one billionaire recently observed, the creator of video games for money doesn't actually buy more happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but rather through personality, which manifested itself in communication with friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joey and Chandler's constant embrace, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross on Rachel - all will come from breathing understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full examination of their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As "Samaritens" employee told me:..." my role of listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal mood underscores how even the little communication of friends can benefit."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to speak with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old teaching "live with it" had much the same as the feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more sustainably working coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlighted little-notable moments of male friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As regards my task, the status of a stranger, talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, for long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends too.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday completely restored the scenery, why not take your friends drink at Central perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better - if you see a lonely person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."</seg>
<seg id="24">In advance not to guess what kind of favor can bring friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">TV series Friends show on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, according to thego # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="3">Ángel di Maria, started in the Champions League, scored for a goal than allowed "PSG" easy to circumvent "Malmö" on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's a report about the match and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ángel di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their case when "Pari Saint-Germain" started their game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Park de Prens" stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League began as a player of "PSG," to set the direction of the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, "Pari" needed to take a good start in the game against champions Sweden because they have focused not on the qualification playoffs, but for the continuation of a series of successful games the last three seasons, where they reach the quarterfinals.</seg>
<seg id="8">They earned points, but at the same time, it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his native city and the club, in which he began his magnificent career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win together with a score of 2: 0, to deliver opponents of problems and play a great defense is a good starting point, even if there are still moments that we will need to finalize during the season," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is promising.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we haven't scored one or two goals more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic came back after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Parisian team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match against Bordeaux in the first league at the weekend, but he shifted" his background to Di Maria's fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine attacker pointed out as a player able to withdraw "PSG" to a new level in Europe after he was bought by Manchester United last month, and he proved why with when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind defending "Malmö" and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johana Villanda into the far corner of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if someone was expecting an easy and big victory from "PSG" then they had to be disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Malmö," which defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, having included nine world-class players on the field early in the game, five defenders and two midfielders in midfield, there was a serious enemy pivot.</seg>
<seg id="16">But except for the hit, Nikola Djurdjic, in which the ball flew past the distant rod gates of Kevin Trappe in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.</seg>
<seg id="17">But "PSG" has at times underwater itself and weak attacks, especially the gears nonultative from Ibrahimovic, who only failed to realize at least five tries in the first half, and then couldn't handle the ball, scored Cavani immediately after the resumption of play.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he showed himself to be a much more skillful in precise pass and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having gained which Di Maria sent the ball curled back, which passed a wyrblow past the 52-minute Vilanda Stange.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal was finally beaten after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, Uruguay scored his sixth goal of the season after after Ibrahimovic ruled the ball sent to the center of the field under the left flank with Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">This put an end to any ideas that were "Malmö" about returning to the game, and only to intercept the ball Wilandom with close range did not allow David Louisa to increase the final score before released to replace Esekjell Lavezzi cannot go to the end of the match during the match read.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmö FF coach Аге Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Qualifying is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Pari" glory!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a wonderful match with them.</seg>

<seg id="11">The forum will also visit representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will work, including from the Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="13">I hope that the forum will help make new profitable contracts and agreements.</seg>

<seg id="15">More than two hundred delegates took part in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was then signed a very important agreement on cooperation between Tyumen and Minsk regions.</seg>

<seg id="20">What topics were discussed?</seg>
<seg id="21">During a meeting with the governor of Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev talked about the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in these difficult conditions today.</seg>
<seg id="22">The question of supplying the Belarusian agricultural machinery and using financial mechanisms are affected - they need to reduce the cost of cars for the end consumer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Problems were discussed in the work of "Belshina" Tyumen trade house and options to prevent losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">Questions are important, because investment projects must clearly work and bring profit for the region.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talked about further deliveries of passenger/cargo vehicles of JSC "MAZ," the development of JSC "MAZ" service centre which has been created in Tyumen on the base of "TPatent P."</seg>

<seg id="31">About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense," because a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, ecologically clean fuel.</seg>
<seg id="32">One more aspect: Tyumen elevator plant works with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator production of JSC "Mogilevliftmash," receiving components.</seg>
<seg id="33">In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the program for installing new elevators at the regional center.</seg>
<seg id="34">I would add that as part of the expanded powers the consul met with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which there was a discussion about increasing the turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Urals region.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the end of September, the planned meeting with the om. governor</seg>
<seg id="36">In an extended consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a district headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="37">The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including work in obrolling the honorary general consul.</seg>
<seg id="38">In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow directly and quickly to solve many problems, removing the sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="39">In current circumstances, it is extremely important not to destroy the foundation, continuing to work for the future.</seg>

<seg id="7">From the prosecutor's office in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk came the Appeal complaint on Friday evening.</seg>

<seg id="9">According to the prosecutor's office, the judge took the wrong decision," said Chukhparadise.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decision to recognise the book "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">To conduct Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization</seg>
<seg id="2">To print the Processes of globalization had to contribute to reducing global inequality.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes in developing economies, by contrast, is growing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Maskin.</seg>
<seg id="5">To fix this, you must raise the level of education of lower-skilled workers, says Senior Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of analysis and choice of decisions HSE, Nobel laureate in economics in 2007, Eric Maskin.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.</seg>
<seg id="8">Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"And these predictions have come true in many ways," Maskin said.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, for example, China and India have received a serious increase in GDP per capita.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, not everyone is so rosy.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifests itself in large income inequality, or, more precisely, wages.</seg>
<seg id="13">But in fact this inequality only increased, said Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and cited NIE HSE.</seg>
<seg id="14">Together with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why the difference in income growth in poor countries as globalization increases, recalls NIE HSE.</seg>
<seg id="15">Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to demonstrate them, Maskin selects four levels of training specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="17">After globalization, professionals from poor countries lack the skill level to D cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the salary level of workers from poor countries is growing thanks to cooperation with C employees from the rich, they do not feel the workers or B D growth at all. wages are falling</seg>
<seg id="19">The final effect is that the internationalization of production will help increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and consequently increase the level of inequality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kremer and E. Maskin offered a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian comparative advantage theory.</seg>
<seg id="21">It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality," said Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory of analysis and choice of solutions, the head of the mathematics department at HSE.</seg>
<seg id="22">And like any powerful theory, I am sure that it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.</seg>
<seg id="23">A solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of lower-skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the workers themselves, as a scientist, do not have this money, and says it isn't profitable for companies to pay for their training.</seg>
<seg id="25">Governments can play a significant role in such a situation, international agencies, NGOs and private funds, says Maskin.</seg>
<seg id="26">The scientist points out that the theory developed in no way calls to halt the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of countries" GDP growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Green Tribunal appeared to be swift crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="2">Typical situation: four officials stand in front of the desk judge Svatanter Kumar, listen to his claims of progress.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court is absolutely not satisfied with the quality of your work.</seg>
<seg id="4">We did not provide you a 110-page order for you to get over it," says Kumar, "enjoy themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is even one brick, we will put all our existing buildings demolished.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kumar leads the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - a judicial body established in 2010 to stem the rapid environmental pollution that accompanies rapid economic growth in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="7">During that time, the Tribunal had considered more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and construction of dams.</seg>
<seg id="8">In two of the three cases, the court decides whether to stop construction leading to pollution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are incredibly high: for nearly 60 years since independence, India's industrial development has changed from a country of virgin jungle growing into one of the most congested and polluted countries in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The problem is particularly acute in big cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste businesses and households, and few remaining residential areas are being cut down for building new residential quarters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State Government, NZT regularly faces criticism from Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">So, in May of this year, the Environment Minister called the court's decision "extreme" and "impossible."</seg>
<seg id="13">Sometimes the court decisions really cannot be performed in a court date, confirms a lawyer for environmental affairs staged by Raj Panjwani.</seg>
<seg id="14">But deadlines are unrealistic and have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons move.</seg>
<seg id="15">"His main aim is to shake up this system," added the lawyer gladly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled large buildings on his account: stopping the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller buildings.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, about people try to not forget too: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, polluted the local river fluoride show.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.</seg>
<seg id="19">"People will lose their jobs," he commented on his decision to Kumar.</seg>
<seg id="20">But such explanations have not always found an understanding of ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of judicial per piece.</seg>
<seg id="21">So, in April, the tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital than had caused a nationwide outcry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Despite sharply rising popularity and a flurry of criticism, Svatanouther Kumar refused to cancel the decision.</seg>
<seg id="23">Instead, he ordered the Delhi government along with statistics about the vehicle entering and going out and made a proposal to buy 10 thousand additional buses after learning at factories, whether they are able to perform a similar pre-order.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the court began to get into the spotlight, such sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger began gradually to storm.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the most sick topic of principled judges was a program to clean up the Ganges river, with fanfare announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.</seg>
<seg id="26">When it comes to Ganga - a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to contain their emotions and moves on to cry.</seg>
<seg id="27">Do you know what the word "holy" means?</seg>
<seg id="28">Somebody poured water from Ganga on the statue of God, and in it were feces - the judge - hot again.</seg>
<seg id="29">You continue to contaminate the river because they think: Ganges, it will take away all of our sins Gang.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ganga cleaning is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government earlier.</seg>
<seg id="32">Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.</seg>
<seg id="33">Each year from 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million bathing in it Indians dying from infectious diseases emerge.</seg>
<seg id="34">In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to Ganga's rescue fund, raised from the sale of the costume in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.</seg>
<seg id="35">Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister in populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.</seg>
<seg id="36">Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India will have to go back a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but it does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.</seg>
<seg id="37">"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as unaffordable luxury," says the activist organization "Zov Ganga" Malik Bhanot.</seg>
<seg id="38">The court is trying to find a middle ground between environmental and development."</seg>
