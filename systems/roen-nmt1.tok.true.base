howev , when ask what is most import to an elect candid , democrat voter prefer the issu instead of elig .
like last month , no democrat candid or possibl candid is consid by these voter as unaccept as the parti 's repres in the presidenti race .
democrat candid or possibl candid are do well in a few key featur to their parti 's primari voter .
most voter see clinton , sander and biden as integr and trustworthi and with solid leadership qualiti .
biden is seen best of all three in term of integr , while clinton 's strong point is leadership .

democrat voter also believ in general that the three , clinton , sander and biden , have the same ideolog as they do .
on all these issu , about a quarter of democrat voter do n't have a view of sander .
how question persist about the use of a person email address and a messag by hillari clinton when she was secretari of state , most democrat voter are happi with her explan on the subject and say she has not affect her general opinion on the candid .

62 % of voter do not see it as reliabl and trustworthi .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voter at nation level do not see trump as trustworthi and trustworthi .
howev , both clinton and trump have been white for leadership .
of the six candid , biden , carson and bush rank first in term of integr .
the number of those who see sander is bigger than those who disagre , though , as in carson 's case , mani do n't have a view of him .

what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
the interest rate will rise and the bull market ( rise market ) will sink , bond profit will rise and the economi will fall into recess .
that is what we know .
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take .
in the economi , histori offer few clue on the time .
after the first rate hike , the recess occur in just 11 month and last 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress to rais interest rate is often , although not alway , a determin factor in how the economi and financi asset have respond .
that is whi the central bank offici in the us have so strong emphasis that investor should not focus on the moment when it start to rais interest rate but on the trajectori of the time need for normalis .
inde , there are multipl variabl in the game .
but in the end , market player could find that all the hype over the interest rate hike has been exagger .
`` the first rate hike decid by the fed after the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some voic as a sign of the era of '' cheap money , `` said julian jessop , chief economist at capit econom , in a note to custom .
on the contrari , we do not expect the gradual return of interest rate in the us to more normal but still small level to constitut the seismic shock that everyon seem to fear .
but it can not be said that there will be no effect .
we continu to present the way in which sever sector of the economi could react , reli on histor trend :
given the situat that the market has experienc in recent month , anticip of an interest rate hike may have wipe out a while .
but at the time the impact is not so dramat .
`` it seem that there is a tendenc for capit profit to falter for 12-24 month after the first increas , which reflect onc again the defect in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent survey on what would happen after fed increas .
more specif , over the past 35 year , the market has risen sharpli - by about 14 percent - head toward an interest rate rise , rather flammabl in the 250-day period after ( an averag of 2.6 per cent ) after return to normal after 500 day , with an averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 per cent , accord to a recent analysi publish on barron by chief strategist of nuveen asset manag .
deutsch said the impact on share tend to becom more pronounc later in the rate hike cycl and benefit start to fall .
recess is a realiti of econom life , but interest rate hike often contribut to it .
in the current situat , the fed face some condit that have not exist befor and which could acceler a recess .
specif , gross domest product will close to it histor minimum point for an increas in the fed 's interest rate .
accord to deutsch bank , of the 118 interest rate increas sinc 1950 , onli twice nomin gdp was less than 4.5 per cent .
even if the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent , few expect the situat to persist , with the third quarter reach just 1.5 per cent , accord to the atlanta fed .
rais the interest rate in such a fragil economi could be riski and could rais the question `` if this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market player have been prepar all the year for a fed growth decis , with all eye glu to this week 's meet of the feder trade market commiss , which close on thursday .
although mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv an interest rate increas dure this meet , futur trade indic a probabl of just 25 per cent .
`` in our survey conduct after 1950 , all the rate of interest rate growth to date were in a super cycl of profit growth , with gdp propag the peak ahead of the recess veri quick after the recoveri began , '' the report said .
on the contrari , this has been a strang slow recoveri after the worst recess in the period under consider .
the current cycl is by far the longest-await fed sinc the end of the last recess ; the record has been 35 month and it has reach 74 month and continu .
fix incom has also been volatil sinc the market predict an interest rate rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividend .
the main differ is that the impact is faster in the bond case than in the case of action when the fed amend polici .
in the bond case , it seem that the benefit are chang the direct as soon as the first growth / drop in the cycl occur .
at the end of the interest rate hike cycl , bond profit is fall immedi , `` deutsch said .
strategi charl schwab believ that these interest rate increas will determin the return of profit between short-term and long-term bond , drive the curv .
high-qual decor are do better in such an environ , although `` we are still wari of forc profit , '' said in an analysi kathi jone , a fix incom analyst at schwab .
interest , jone believ market have alreadi adjust to fed polici expect .
`` besid the strength of the dollar and the estim disinfl , there are a few sign that the market has adapt to the prospect of a more rigor monetari polici , '' jone wrote .
short-term interest rate have risen , curba profit is more right , the averag mortgag interest rate rise has expand and volatil has increas - all the market 's characterist when fed tighten polici .
broad , compani oper in the us will benefit from an interest rate increas and local product will becom more attract .
larg debt with high debt will suffer becaus the rise of the dollar will lead to the increas in their product into the global market space and their debt will be more expens .
`` histori show that '' qualiti `` stock tend to be more profit in the three month follow an initi interest rate hike , '' analyst goldman sach said in a report to custom .
firm with strong balanc sheet surpass those with a weak balanc sheet after each of the interest rate increas in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , with an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high capit revenu and low-volatil stock also surpass similar-qu compani with an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) .
debt will becom an import issu .
compani with a larg percentag of float debt have the most to lose , goldman say .
consum will also benefit from rise the dollar .
those who save may also have to gain , although expert do not agre on how quick this will happen .

advantag and disadvantag of swiss franc loan convers
in the bank market , two offer of cash convers in the swiss franc have alreadi emerg , with the main advantag be exclud currenc risk and cut rate .
the disadvantag can come in a few year , when variabl interest can lead to higher rate .
the transylvania bank has just finish the process on the convers of loan to franc grant by volkbank , and the post bank announc the convers offer for it own custom .
accord to data compil by analyst of the financi portal finzoom , the post bank offer three year of fix interest to lion , 1.5 per cent , the lowest on the market .
on the other hand , the transylvania bank 's convers offer was accept by 83 per cent of credit custom in the franc thank to two success cut : it has narrow solitud with the valu of risk and administr fee paid by the custom , then appli an extra 22.5 per cent to solitud in the lion .
both offer reduc the rate of their own custom , compar to how they pay month equival in the lion befor the convers .
thus , the bank of transylvania is reduc the rate by 42.5 % and the post bank , with 33 % in the first three year and , in theori , 18 % over the come year .
benefit
the main advantag of the redempt of credit in chf is that the currenc risk is be remov , with the consum be protect by the futur increas in the franchis , and repay will be made in the currenc in which it collect it salari .
anoth major advantag of both convers offer is that no reassess of the properti is made , no addit guarante and other incom proof are requir .
in practic term , there will be no new financi and legal analysi of credit , nor will it be addit cost as in the case of a refund .
both bank also offer a cut to the month rate , compar to how custom pay befor the convers , equival to the lion .
risk
the problem is that the rate in the first few year is made up of interest , and the custom is repay veri littl from the main .
the low-interest post 's offer in the first three year seem advantag to custom .
it is unclear , howev , how this interest will evolv after three year .
the margin offer to custom can be higher than 3.25 per cent , so in total , and the cost reduct is lower .
a possibl risk for all loan in variable-r lion is that the robor index will grow signific over the next few year ( more than the libor index - chf ) .
for exampl , robor to three month is now 1.44 % , but in 2013 , at 6 % , in 2009 , at more than 15 % , and in a few day of 2008 , it exceed 40 % !
in addit , it is possibl to defend other cost , too , in the initi offer .

adam lyth has clear risk the omiss of england but is still stand up
the victori against pakistan in the unit arab emir is a difficult task but , have seen the team select by england for the tournament , they are not consid a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test match .
i would not elimin the variant of a race victori either .
perhap alastair cook 's team has less experi than three year ago , but he has good player on thorn in the bat line and the collect moral is strong ; they will not be mark by the event in 2012 but will have a posit posit attitud .
moeen ali is evolv as spider and adil rashid , even if it 's unknown at the level of test , is an option for the attack .
relat subject : adam lyth left england team for test match and was replac by alex helect
obvious as his main coach in yorkshir , it 's difficult to look at the decis not to select adam lyth in the squad .
he play the seven test match against two good striker , in difficult condit , and the simpl but tough realiti is that cricket player are judg after the result .
there were no question about joe root , for exampl , until the announc were made becaus - and i said that previous - the player are their own select .
ani fifti year , and perhap lyth would have extend his temper , but his destini is in his hand .
i hope that if it make more iphon for yorkshir it will have some other opportun .
england 's head coach trevor bayliss prais his attitud even when spotifi was n't on the measur of his abil and it doe n't surpris me that ; first of all , he 's a team man .
it 's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is note in the test match .
lyth had seven tweet - like sam robson ahead of him - while nick compton had nine .
onli compton had luck at home and travel .
the onli complaint you can have was that england prefer jonathan trott in the caribbean tour - when lyth was in full form - but that miss opportun is of the past .
in the team come alex helect , a batsman i 'm bowl veri well .
he 's a cricket player who has the `` x factor '' and which i notic earli in yorkshir this season when he mark 236 against us at a trent champion .
it should be given at least the same opportun as those befor him , but this will , of cours , depend on the composit of the uae team .
the idea of moeen was launch to open up with cook , which would lead extra spacecraft while keep four buck , and i have noth against it .
i do n't see whi a punter could n't hit there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he 's given naibi .
perhap moeen did n't bring success in his district , worcestershir , but he was no 3 for them , so the differ is not great .
my old team teammat justin langer play his first 38 test match 38 as the shark befor enter the open in 2001 .
he wipe out three centuri away and did n't look behind .
zafar anjump come to the team on the post-up spider post and although i ve had limit contact with him , it struck me that he 's a veri impress young man .
peopl might judg the earli age - with an averag of 31 to beat and 35 on the ball - and they might think it 's a punt , but there 's no bunch of nest and the select opt for youth .
it 's go to learn a lot from this tournament .
england have brought some chang to the coach team as well .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lankan batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a headmast .
he 's one of the best player and he will bring a lot of experi , given he play in ani situat and against all sort of attack .
paul collingwood come for the white bowl of the tournament and will bring both energi and ruthless ambit .
i alway thought he was born to get involv in intern cricket , whether as a player or as a coach , and like mahela , he has intuit .
sometim , the new voic in the vestiar , even if they transmit messag that have been pass and previous , can bring fresh air into the team .
colli durham 's teammat ben stoke rest for one-day match , root has got a similar break against australia and i have no problem with that .
while i do n't all agre , coach and coach do not do the program .
and you have to note , player ' job depend on the result they get .

brexit camp could have the gain if the economi keep in franchis by 2017
as it pass , david cameron 's renegoti strategi to keep britain into the eu is get deeper into the mess , even without the select of brilliant jeremi `` yes or not ? '' corbyn at the helm of the labour parti or ttip bring serious critic to europ on tuesday .
stranger also have charact like corbyn and nigel fargo .
a european diplomat explain last day that - submerg in similar crise with the one in the eu - not all of them be made domest - some member state are fed up with britain 's agenda of concess and chang to the treati , which the major do not want .
in brighton , on the occas of the annual meet , tuc decid they did n't want it if they erod social protect .
we could even call it the `` selfi '' agenda of dave and georg .
the prime minist and chancellor attend summit or bilater session in foreign capit , make a pois in front of a famous local monument , with or without the local repres , then return home and say they have gain alli for reform .
it 's just about me .
my european friend , who want a great britain with the prospect of outsid under the roof of the eu - `` we do n't let ourselv with franc , '' berlin say - suggest that more minist and short-sight offici from some capit have reach the point where they do n't care if they stay or leav .
angela merkel , the high cautious german chancellor , is an alli but has stood at the helm for 10 year and want to leav the posit befor her situat click , how it happen to thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) , who sat too much .
in 2017 , franc 's presid françoi holland will be re-elect or replac .
and his strength is in declin .
poland could soon have a right-w nationalist govern , spain one on the left .
it 's hard to believ they will help the english who pose , whose energi would be better use to prevent scotland from come out of britain - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some minist may even be plan remark that do not help , in the snp 's style , in the uk referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the brexit process , my mum suggest .
`` the renegoti was fix '' and `` britain did n't get anyth of valu from renegoti . ''
european know on their skin how live it can be , and how sceptic they are from the oligarch media who view the eu with sceptic , becaus they did not particip in the 1975 referendum inspir by toni benn that ratifi our 1973 entri into report 2 : 1 .
he can vagu recal bori johnson , the euro-opportunist , who becam famous in the earli 1990s when he was in brussel .
ed miliband knew his enemi .
they includ the mixtur to find non-pay , foreign who defraud the phone and pseudo-domi who hold most of the key newspap .
in fact , toni blair is see him a littl bit , but he realis that when ed is lock in a cage with a nervous gorilla , you have to give them banana to distract them from the thought of eat at lunch and again at tea .
in fact , miliband was more blairit than blair in opposit to cameron 's idea of a referendum , given that blair made a concess on the principl of the abandon eu constitut , buri by french and dutch voter in 2005 , who gave him a exit card .
the press has not forgiven him for that either .
but jeremi corbyn , who struck me girlfriend in the back on monday at westminst - told him not to consum his time with me - seem to be at risk to take the murdoch strategi to boycott neil kinnock in the 1980s , a mistak then and now .
it can last , but it has to develop a coher strategi of cooper with the media , not with me , but with certainti with andrew marr whose posit on the bbc left her holiday on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit toward europ is what i would call a breakthrough .
he say he would like to stay in a reform eu .
most of those who disagre with the tori `` anglic could agre to that .
that 's what hilari `` a benn , but not a benn '' benn on radio and tv this week , when the research in him struggl not to admit that the appoint of john mcdonnel by corbyn as the `` shadow '' minist on financi issu was a bad idea .
he remind me of the 1970s when his father struggl on tv to be unfair to labour colleagu without go too far and lose his offic in the cabinet .
hilari 's fight was more attract .
but the fight to stay `` in ani situat '' - benn 's express - doe not correspond to what mcdonnel said , nor what jc told colleagu and mps at the privat meet on monday night .
regardless of the imag that corbyn want to convey - note , it also made me awar of me - the disciplin of messag remain import in the era of televis , and especi in the pool of social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it is right not to give cameron a ticket to favour in europ , allow him to take good support for labour in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel said .
simon jenkin certain believ this .
but mcdonnel 's basic drive and corbyin on eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a heat discuss among left-w dissid for which the femin of small differ is a central dogma .
as with his leadership on nato - tom watson is adam that jc will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomat will be compel to tri to understand .
whi should pari or berlin becom polit capit - and there are suspici voter - for concess to britain when everyth could be useless ?
the us is alreadi pretti disappoint with the weak militari perform of the english in iraq , libya and syria , even with a tori govern cut cost , as i was remind of the launch of british foreign affair forum on monday .
specialist critic public health depart 's decis in england on electron cigarett
accord to the research , the claim of a govern agenc that electron cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke result in a meet between 12 peopl , some of which are link to the tobacco industri .
specialist from the british medic journal 's editori team ( bmj ) have join lancet in criticis the evid use by the public health depart of england ( phe ) in it report on electron cigarett .
phe publish the `` landmark '' report last month and describ it as a `` complex analysi of evid . ''
sever research , howev , question the reliabl of the data and point to link between certain expert and the tobacco industri .
an articl publish last month in the lancet medic magazin attack the `` extraordinarili fragil base '' he found on the main conclus .
two other research who write in bmj have question the claim and set them `` on solid soil or on the sand . ''
martin mckee , a european public health professor at the london school of hygien and tropic , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at liverpool univers , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici must be base on evid of effect . ''
they said they expect the phe claim that `` current estim show that electron cigarett are 95 per cent less harm than smoke '' are base on a detail analysi of evid and model .
in realiti , a singl meet attend by 12 peopl led to the draw up of a multi-prong decision-analysi model ( mcda ) that would summaris their view on the negat effect associ with differ product contain nicotin ; the result of this meet were briefli present in a research work .
mckee and capewel said one of the sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , which the execut director said would have receiv fund from british american tobacco in the past year to conduct an independ studi .
it also valid bat 's accredit in public health in a report on sustain , he said .
they ad that one of the 12 particip in the meet said the fund receiv from a produc of electron cigarett , but not the fund that there were report that they would have receiv it from cigarett and tobacco compani philip morri intern .
the argument have not been provid on the basi of which member of the tabl have been select , but among them are a few rainbow ' known in the product of electron cigarett , some of them even say in the work of industri fund .
other particip at the meet are not known for the expertis in tobacco control .
the head of the tobacco control station in phe also attend the meet .
the research paper draft by the group `` convinc whitewash '' the fact that there is a lack of `` solid evid of the harm effect that most product have accord to most criteria , '' mckee and capewel said .
howev , there is no mention of ani of these link or limit in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said ms e 's claim that `` to date there is no evid that electron cigarett are a factor encourag smoke among children or non-smok '' are prematur .
professor kevin fenton , director of the cfe health depart , say he has respond in the past to claim in bmj .
he said : `` electron marijuana is signific less harm than smoke ''
one in two peopl who smoke all life is lose their live becaus of this vice .
all the evid suggest that the risk pose by electron health cigarett is minor compar , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about inform aris and those that do not stem from evid , especi given the high degre of public confus about relat danger relat to tobacco .
annual , some 880,000 peopl lose their live due to a diseas associ with smoke , and the annual cost incur by the nhs due to smoke reach £2 billion .
it is clear to the current evid - name that , although the use of electron cigarett is not without risk , they present onli a fraction of the harm effect of smoke - we are fulfil our nation debt .

violinist david grimal : in bach 's era there were no world tournament .
beethoven , brahm , barbour , enescu were peopl who were work , artist and not commerci repres .
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artist of our time , known not onli as solitari but also as initi of a less ordinari project , downright `` weird , '' as he even say , les dissonoo - an orchestra consist of intern soloist and talent musician , who perform a symphon repertoir without have a conductor , and that make it at least a curios in the classic music landscap .
les dissonoo was this year at the billboard festiv with two perform : a perform , on sunday , in which solist was david grimal , the founder of the orchestra , and one on monday , when the front-runn xavier phillip was locat in the foreground , with the co-op artwork be unfaz .
both perform , conduct on the athenian stage , have shown the public a differ kind of classic music .
les dissonoo appear on the music scene in 2004 be , at the time , the onli classic music ensembl where there is no conductor .
the conductor is the most import musician for musician .
it is true , on the one hand , the musician need an educ either to becom soloist or to becom interpret in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalist , rather than compos .
they are train as `` specialist worker . ''
they themselv have the impress they need a conductor .
on the other side of the scene , for the public , all the feisti music is focus on conductor .
and so the genr , the music industri , is do it market .
so we re not talk about music anymor .
so if you look at this world , we have some skill worker , which is stupid , and a public that ca n't listen , but they have to look , which is stupid , `` say david grimal .
the violinist say that this chang in the way he make music came in the wake of his `` music decept '' from her solitari career .
i was like a high-level athlet who had to do the same exercis around the world with differ orchestra , to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industri .
10 year ago , when i was around 30 year old , i found this veri depress , becaus we did not find the creativ and the human fratern in this system .
so i ve never found ani sens of continu on this road .
so i decid to creat les dissonoo .
that 's in 2004 , and at the time no one was do so without a conductor : `` the music world , high conserv , did n't want such project . ''
`` how do you imagin do market with a collect of musician where there is no ego ? '' the artist ask .
david grimshaw acknowledg that les dissonar is `` a luxuri , '' ad that none of the musician who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live .
in 10 year of the exist of the ensembl , the lack of a conductor has not prove to be a stumbl block in the song act : `` curious , the more complex repertoir we play , the simpler it seem , becaus all musician are requir to be present in the opera and not onli in the role , '' grimal say , ad that on sunday 's show `` i was 74 conductor on stage . ''
in grimal 's view , the enescu festiv is a `` veri brave '' one , precis becaus it also invit les dissonoo : `` an extraordinari festiv , where the greatest orchestra in the world are present that sing and 3 time a day , and in the middl of these guest orchestra and this strang group . ''
in a templ of the orchestra tradit , such as the enescu festiv , there is the place and interest for someth differ , which break down barrier .
speak about the opera of enescu , the violinist admit he feel romanian music of the famous romanian compos , so he did n't need a special approach when he introduc work of his hand in his repertoir .
grimal note that mason 's music is veri instinct , but that 's when we talk about georg enescu and romanian music , `` becaus there is also a georg enescu who has made french music . ''
grimshaw campaign to chang the way classic music educ is made , believ that `` the musician 's profess , as it is organis today , has a quiz of death '' and that `` the futur of music is music itself . ''
we do not need to tour the world 5 time a year if it doe not serv to do anyth .
in bach 's era there were no world tournament .
beethoven , brahm , barbour , enescu were peopl who were work , who were artist and not commerci repres .
for me , organis concert , festiv , tour , the launch of album , all are formid , extraordinari , but as long as they do in the music servic .
if we do not , we are in a system where creativ is suffer , no longer has freedom .
to illustr this phenomenon , david grimal gave exampl to romanian product befor and post membership in the european union : `` in romania , befor you enter the eu , you have good veget and meat . ''
to enter the eu we had to adopt sanitari law that are not good for veget and meat .
product and agricultur reach the supermarket servic , as is also the case in franc .
with music happen the same thing , it 's the same logic .
les dissonoo make tomato perhap not too nice , but when you cut them are true tomato .
in an ideal world , it should be for this music to return to the centr and that the institut and industri that manag this system understand that music doe not need to be sold , but need to be share , and this can be done from educ polici .
`` if we thought - as the korean do , the chines , the japanes - that western music is one of human 's most beauti thing , we would reintroduc learn to school , re-introduc concert on tv and through this educ there would be no need to sell music product , '' grimal believ .
they are certain thing in classic music educ that remain veri communist , that 's everywher , it 's someth veri militaris .
it depend on this disciplin if you compar a musician with a soldier , or if we form a musician who will perform at a tool , and , first of all , musician .
we are talk about a complet differ educ if we want to form a soldier ( this educ - n.red . ) has to be in a way , if we want to form a musician , it 's all someth els .
after your hair , what 's more danger , a soldier or a musician ? `` ask the french artist smile .
grimal show that , for artist , the reward of anoth kind of make music come just from overcom this status of `` soldier , '' overcom what `` they think are their limit '' : `` musician discov at a certain point that they are not soldier , and that 's whi after the concert i come out smile . ''
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision of music and the artist as part of the `` festiv of idea , '' a discuss with the public at the georg enescu intern festiv by the aspen romania institut .

the fall estim come despit rise price by 4.9 per cent on averag , with entri into forc on 4 januari and higher overcharg for land transport of larg or high-weight packag , which will appli sinc novemb .
the compani said it is still expect to increas earn from the previous year as a result of lower cost , higher revenu and the develop of onlin trade .
presid and director-gener fred smith said `` the compani is face a consider weaker econom situat than expect , particular in term of global product and trade . ''
the hire plan dure the holiday period were announc a day after the up contest said he plan to hire 990,000-95,000 extra worker , about the same number of worker he made last year .
in the quarter that end on 31 august , fedex earn $ 692 million , 6 per cent more than the previous year .
the share per share were $ 2.42 , below the averag estim of $ 2.44 per action made by 12 analyst who respond to the survey conduct by zack invest research .

fedex has been hit in recent year of a declin in intern prioriti shipment , lead to the stagnat of revenu record by it express unit .
but the explos in onlin shop has salt the result of the fedex cup divis .
in the last quarter , the revenu of the global divis rose by 29 % , but oper revenu have basic stall due to higher cost for larg packag and their own insur .
the u.s. unit record an increas in revenu thank to higher base charg , while earn record by the fremantl divis fell due to rise cost .
on pre-market trade , about an hour befor the start-up sound , fedex share were up 3.85 dollar or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
on tuesday , the closur fell 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent from the record maximum on june 11th .
on the occas of the most expect meet in recent year , policymak in the fed will spend two day this week around a tabl of mahon hondura with 27 feet to decid whether the time has come to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
abov them , at an end of the central bank 's sit room , a mural of the unit state will be seen .
the map is meant to recal that janet l. yellen , the fed presid , and her colleagu must put the nation 's econom interest abov anyth .
the central bank has receiv a dual task from congress : to maximis employ rate in the us and maintain price stabil .
but sinc the big econom crisi , fed leader have confirm there is a third unwritten task : financi stabil .
and this third task could be the x factor in a decis too difficult to predict , which will be announc on tuesday , and which will determin whether the us economi is readi to be disloc by the unpreced incent offer by the near-zero interest rate in forc sinc the end of 2008 .
even though most data point to a grow economi , recent turmoil on global financi market may scare fed offici alreadi wari of ad volatil by rais the benchmark rate to feder fund - even with a percentag point of percentag point .
`` obvious , the labour market and inflat will be the first and the main issu they will follow , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag compani stigen nicolaus & co .
`` i think , howev , that if they were look for an excus not to increas the interest rate , grow uncertainti on the world market is suffici to give them argument to wait , '' she said .
there is no consensus on the decis that the fed will take , with this in itself caus instabl in the financi market .
about half of economist poll recent by bloomberg predict an interest rate rise this week .
but financi market expect the fed to delay , a key indic show the likelihood of growth is onli 30 per cent .
that would indic a fall on the stock market if the fed rais interest rate unless those who draw up polici would soften the blow by promis that it would take a long time to the next increas .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag climb 228.89 point , or 1.4 percent , to 16.599.85 .
the aviva was trigger by expect that fed decis maker will keep the rate stabl this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market group .
`` it would be surpris for the fed to rais the interest rate at the moment , '' lonski said .
if fed decis maker would do so , `` they should act in depth in their polici to avoid panic in financi market . ''
other expert said an interest rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti over when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed appear to be on track to rais rate by 0.25 per cent this month , the first small step toward the slow tighten of monetari condit that would confirm the strength of the us recoveri .
yellen said in the spring and earli summer that he was expect an interest rate rise this year despit the object rais by liber how more econom progress would be need .
while job creation slow in august , the growth of the labour market was solid this year .
the unemploy rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month , the lowest percentag in more than seven year and close to the level consid by the fed as total employ .
pay rise have shown sign of growth .
and while inflat has continu not to meet the central bank 's annual target , fed decis maker said a key reason was the temporari effect of fall oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate and need them , given the strain on the labour market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macrooo .
but global financi market began to enter the fiancé later this month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag fell 16 per cent below the record maximum reach in may as investor fear slow the chines economi would drag global growth down .
the market slip somewhat this month , with the dow index now about 10 per cent below the maximum in may .
for fed decis maker , the market buzz is ad to the complex calcul of the interest rate hike .
`` without what has happen on the financi market and the news about weaken the chines economi in recent week , it would be more decis in the sit , '' said stephen d. onier , an experienc research at ucla ziman center for real estat and former fed offici .
now he is expect to wait at least a month to manag the effect better .
`` there is a lot of uncertainti about what the impact will be on the us economi , and they almost have no data on which to later reli on event in china , '' odom said .
the eclips of the global economi is not one of the fed 's major interest , so virtual it should not be consid in decision-mak .
but in realiti , the fed has becom the global monetari author .
in recent year , the influenc of the central bank has been huge .
a mere hint of then-presid ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed could `` narrow '' the monetari expans trigger the earthquak on global market .
in a world where market and economi are increas negat , it is expect that fed offici are not onli abl to monitor progress in other area , but also to consult with other central bank and expert to better interpret the world economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari cowel , head of the global strategi depart at the welfar manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , feder reserv bank presid in richmond , viti. , said this month that `` fed has a huge reaction track to chang in the financi market that appear not to be relat to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the feder committe on open market , the decision-mak bodi , which advoc interest rate hike , provid the 1998-99 decis as an exampl .
a financi crisi that has affect asia has led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent in three meet , `` despit implic with limit identif possibl for us develop , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici return to the charg .
the edf should put the issu of financi stabil in the first place onli in the event of a major crisi , such as the 2008 market earthquak , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's interest rate set committe .
the last turbul period is nowher near the level , he said .
`` certain we do n't want to get into the situat of afraid of an interest rate increas becaus they have upset the market , '' posen , chairman of the institut for intern econom , said .
the feder reserv act still hold the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil and , until someth is chang in this regard , i do not think it should take prematur action .

follow the crash , 107 peopl die and near 400 were injur .
how to shut them off the mouth of the challeng
consid by mani world the biggest romanian footbal in histori , gica hagi has been label , after retir from the work , as a poor coach , who can not be abl to perform in the new posit as well .
after unhappi experi at the nation team , star or galatasaray , hagi took over , a year ago , the coach role at the futur of constanta , the team they are sponsor .
after a year after the team took over , king show he was capabl of turn a team that was lie to save from releg in one of the top .
so after a year of day , the futur record , with hagger , 16 win , 11 rebound and 11 defeat .
the billionair is one of a top team , which is knock on european cup .
thing took an even better turn for the futur this season as the team reach second place in the leagu 1 with 19 point , one less than the leader astra giurgiu .
the futur also has the best attack in leagu 1 , with 20 goal ( par with glass ) , more than doubl than the star .
on the other hand , even though he brought to the team more experienc player , hagi continu the polici of promot young peopl , and in the last period in the start-up team there were name like iani hagi or hodorogea .
the club 's polici has made the futur a team of watch for team abroad , so hagi has sold 1.5 million euro this summer - iani hagi ( fiorentina - 1 million euro ) and alexand mitrita ( bari - 500 euro ) .
alongsid star war , the futur is the onli profit team in the premier leagu , accord to data from the trade registri .
in the refuge crisi , romania has so far play as a small countri .
it is a legitim strategi , but then you can not ask to be treat as the seventh eu countri .
larg countri are come up with solut for the whole of the eu , say cristian ghea , a member of the colleg director of the romanian centr for european polici .
in an interview with ziare.com , cristian ghoud show that europ can not be transform into a fortress , and the pure polic mean will not work in this crisi : `` perhap we have doubt about the qualiti of the valu that these peopl come from . ''
but they are the mass who have embark on and we can not return histori .
migrat is a realiti that we need to adapt to as well as possibl and to adapt them to us .
in cristian ghea 's view , we are at an extrem emot moment where politician feel the need to show their muscl .
after he pass , european will not be will to give up freedom of movement , but the rule in the schengen area must be chang : schengen is now like an anim creat in anoth age and which has not been adapt for the situat of now ' .
where are we in the refuge crisi after this jha council which , in fact , has not solv anyth ?
it is clear that the ec presid in agreement with donald tusk did not want to forc a vote on the board .
all the pronoun were say they would have had the necessari vote .
befor the treati of lisbon , in jha , the principl of unanim appli and ani state could block ani decis .
that is whi thing have been veri littl integr in the field of justic and home affair .
after lisbon , the normal procedur appli , in which the ec has the initi , and the board approv with the vote of 55 % of state , name 16 , which account for 65 % of the eu 's popul .
the calcul were say the vote were there .
but they did n't want to go forward .
becaus it is a sensit issu , there has been a reject reaction even in germani against chancellor merkel 's open polici and did not want in mani countri to appear that an eu-typ reaction send us migrant to the head. ``
they have therefor postpon , but the problem remain becaus , obvious , this wave creat a huge problem for the govern of schengen and we will probabl see big chang there in the come period .
so mandatori quota were not realli discard , but the subject was just left to cool ?
yes , on the other hand , there is talk of greater involv by frontex in the manag of extern border , which mean a chang from the individu respons of member who are at the extern border of schengen to the respons of communiti agenc .
greec 's border with turkey is also the german border with turkey , de facto , and this wave of migrant has given the limit to the old schengen system .
perhap the dublin principl will be drop , accord to which migrant are the respons of the state in which it is the first time , becaus it is unsustain .
if greec is pot , you can not simpli say that it is greec 's job .
the problem is common .
precis becaus the problem is common , is it possibl to resolv it without a precis , perhap bind , mechan for share the effort of the recept ?
no one know exact how compulsori quota will work , if they get to them .
becaus it remain a problem : what do you do with a man who doe not want to come to romania or portug , but in sweden or germani ?
i do not believ that the european state will be abl to take the migrant on top of the migrant : you go to the countri of x or in the countri of y .
there will probabl be some singl filter centr , in greec or in turkey , where asylum applic can be appli .
it is work on solut like this .
but the problem doe not have a simpl solut .
there are countri that have decad of experi in tri to integr migrant , they are countri without ani experi , as romania , where the problem of migrant will increas their hatr .
the fact is that we are talk about million of peopl who are in turkey , in lebanon , in jordan , who are in precari camp and who have just start to go to europ .
one estim say that onli 10 per cent were go to leav , winter is hard for the mediterranean , but we expect the next year at a potenti even bigger wave .
what do we do with peopl ?
my mum is that we re go to get use to this problem , we re not go to look so catastroph from a media point of view .
swung by countri with lower or higher experi .
doe it seem to me that there is ani place where the integr of larg group from a supra-european cultur realli succeed ?
i look at the magreav in franc , to turk in germani , they are all in-depth .
i would not go toward radic statement .
sure , their integr is more difficult than in other wave of migrat , but that doe not mean that they do not integr at all .
it remain an unintegr part that creat major social problem in franc , in germani , in the uk .
but pure mean will not work .
let us creat the fortress europ is illusori .
we must humili the integr mechan in european societi .
here were some mistak .
we need to be more pretenti .
let them ask these peopl to learn the languag , tri to take up the valu , not to stay with one foot in europ and one in their home countri , bring the rest of the famili , includ through marriag of conveni .
howev , the immin problem of these peopl with the long-term problem of their integr must be separ .
if other have fail in long-term integr , it doe not mean that we must look at them how they are drown in the mediterranean .
perhap we have doubt about the qualiti of the valu that these peopl come from .
and if it 's go to be an intervent in syria , what i do n't think , it doe n't mean it 's go to recov the countri overnight and you can take it back .
until we defend solut , we see the fortress within europ .
border have been close , wall are be erect , border control are be re-introduc in the schengen area .
is the european project at risk ?
the european project as such is not , the schengen area as it was built , yes .
it was built quit minim and arrang the rule so the pressur was too high on the countri where they put these migrant on foot for the first time .
that is , we are move freeli by colo , but everi e with her problem .
in the face of such a wave , this is not the case , becaus some countri are not cope .
when there are such wave of emot , politician want to show they do someth , but in the long term it doe n't chang much .
after the bomb in franc , we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legisl in the eu than we had last year .
it is a wave of public emot that is be instal in both sens .
and it 's so unstabl from one week to the other that you ca n't make decis base on them .
we have a lot of talk , mani bellic statement from politician at home under the pressur to be virus .
and then you have the dramat case of the child drown in turkey and public opinion is move .
after the public emot goe through , we will return to the reason whi we have creat this area , this freedom of movement that is not onli for peopl , but also for good .
this is the singl european singl market .
and i do not believ that european will give up this principl of free movement .
that will be other rule .
schengen is now like an anim creat in anoth age and which has not been adapt for the situat now .
is romania how it has play so far in this crisi ?
like a small countri , which believ that if it shoot as an eye and ast their ear , the theme disappear .
in the face of the realiti of wave of migrant , you can choos to be part of the solut or to say that it is not your small countri .
that is what we have done , it is a legitim strategi , but then you can not ask to be treat as the seventh eu countri .
do n't eknow , you do n't play at home level .
larg countri come up with solut for the whole of the eu , good or bad , and we are not talk about their qualiti now .
the saa as poland has done .
on the other hand , the effect of this crisi is that the appetit of romanian for schengen will decreas great .
presid joseph hanni say it is perhap good that we have not alreadi enter .
so we move from the desper to a more pragmat posit , but the goal remain .
there is , of cours , a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen for migrant to see us as an altern rout .
that doe not mean that it is a reason not to enter schengen , but to be more pragmat .
romania will be part of schengen , and schengen will exist , but made in the sens that extern border will becom common respons , will be singl rule for the accept of migrant , singl deport rule for those who do not receiv asylum , singl rule for countri deem safe .
the ukrainian presid said that after russia move it attent to syria in ukrain , no one die .
is there a connect between the two outbreak , a game of russia ?
russia has a frustrat power of power .
she believ that be a great power mean to confront american and european .
from that point of view , yes , there is a connect .
without the militari and financi effort of the putin regim , the assad regim would probabl have collaps long ago .
and it was good to crash befor his main oppon was the islam state .
ani two year have been a fight between the assad regim and moder secular and muslim militia back by gulf and western countri .
then there was the islam state , and now we do n't know if the assad regim want to fall .
russia has been abl to complic thing , but can not particip in the solut .
it creat outbreak of instabl and chao that it can not close .
but esti great power onli if you have solut .
the off-sid game is just a strategi to win time .
putin is like to be offer offer , app him on the button to fix the situat .
the offer do not come becaus the world is not convinc that he can somehow solv the issu creat by him .
but i do n't agre with the theori that say these peopl are manner by an invis hand .
let 's not see putin stronger than he is .

they had the accid and remain in cardiac arrest
the trial of seven rapist from the cowboy move , yesterday , to the ibiza court of appeal .
parramatta have tri the first trial term in an undisclos session in which the seven young men accus of mock an 18-year-old woman have ask to be put at larg .
prior to the actual start of the courtroom , one of the extraordinari judg who had been assign the file , viorel munteanu , formul a request for abstent , which was admit by his colleagu at the court .
the magistr has been sworn in this year at the vaslui tribun , where he was the chairman of the pistorius section , he was the one who , on 9 april , admit a disput made by four of the defend , with their placement under hous arrest .
current , the file is judg by a full of which includ magistr maricica mititelu and geta raymond .
previous , in the file she formul a abstent and judg dan birton on the ground that his daughter is in a relationship of competit with one of the rapist ' lawyer .
the two judg decid that rapist from the cowboy continu to remain in cardiac arrest .
ti cub will remain jail for at least anoth 30 day , when jude yorker will re-discuss the possibl of put them at larg .
the trial deadlin will be held at the ibiza court of appeal on 6 octob .
befor reach the ibiza court of appeal , the duba with which the rapist were transport from the cowboy was involv in a crash in the packer neighborhood , the car enter isi on the belt .
autoslitara iveco with whom the seven rapist were transport hit a volk commodor car float on the street and the driver tri to cook on the left .
the duba is move from the end of the packer .
the car went into ibiza on the ground becaus the penrith fire administr employe prefer the rout from the cowboy to ibiza on graphen , then on the belt .
they have thus cut the road a few kilometr .
immedi after the impact , escort arrest anoth shipment to take over the inmat .
short , at the scene of the crash , a car was sent from pennington high safeti station , which took the seven inmat and transport them to the court of appeal .
in the aftermath of the crash , none of the detaine were injur .
to transfer them to the other duba , the guard surround the rear side of the masi shark , and the detain took off the speed , two by two .

big migrat
romania is neither nor will it be readi for what to follow .
but europ ?
i say it from the outset , clear and clear : the 20 000 refuge they should and must naturalis romania is , in itself , an insignific but huge number compar to the abil of the romanian state to manag such a project .
for romania , even the voluntari quota propos by bucharest , amount to around 1 500 discard , is far beyond our good intent of solidar with the european union in recent month .
sure , if those migrant even accept to settl in our citi , the chanc of rapid integr them into romanian societi are extraordinarili small .
i am convinc that they will be the first to lose their patienc .
paraz by mobster and paralys by a venom polit class , the romanian state is prove bog down in all area .
be abl to integr gypsi is just a banal exampl .
in addit to that , govern of ani colour have not been abl to absorb european fund , make road , kindergarten or modern school , ensur decent medic care , rais the mess on the street , creat paid job or keep their young generat home .
whi would refuge settl into anoth countri in which it is run away ?
but what make a lot of wonder is particular the hypocrisi with which such a crisi is be treat .
we are first hit by the bellicia of the eu 's strong state , which show maximum generos when it come to share the problem with smaller countri .
then come the friction of romanian who , although they have million of peopl scatter everywher in the world , do not yet accept the other - anoth languag , anoth religion , anoth blood .
he is probabl afraid not to steal his carpet .
after all , there is also a hypocrisi of mani migrant , who , although they cite onli the horror of war as a reason for the departur , do not accept ani other destin of the exodus than germani or the nordic countri .
howev , not all refuge are syrian , and in pakistan there is no war .
likewis , the simplist way in which the crisi is consid can onli be mock .
the caus must be remov , i support some and , by strict speak on the card of polit correct , call for peac and invest for the countri of origin of migrant .
but in romania , there is peac , and even more , from time to time , some foreign capit in the nation economi - but that doe not prevent ten of thousand of romanian from leav their countri everi year .
whi do they leav ?
in this crisi , the european union has been reveal to us as an anatomi , divis and outdat construct .
i am complain that romania is not abl to invent a countri project , but the fact that neither the eu has ani plan for the futur .
and improvis and threat do n't help anyth .
then , what more is the eu use , if the onli advantag enjoy by romanian - the right to free movement - could be put into question becaus of the wave of refuge cross the border as a chees ?
at some point , the war in syria will end .
not the migrant crisi , howev .
over the come decad , overcrowd , poverti , climat chang , deplet of resourc etc . will push million of desper migrant , from asia and especi from africa to a better life .
with such politician , romania is neither nor will it ever be readi for what to follow .

corbyn , brexit and europ 's futur
from econom and demograph caus , the prosper enjoy over the last few decad can not continu the same way in the come year .
by saturday , a littl world knew in romania who is jeremi corbyn .
even today , after he becam the new leader of the labour parti in britain , mani wonder to what extent it can affect our choic of a politician who , after all , is not in a posit posit .
jeremi corbyn is the most radic leftist leader of post-war labour .
the declar , anti-monarchi ( ask him at one point to toni blair , then the prime minist , to take the royal famili out of buckam palac ) , a rude anti-american and a sympathis of vladimir putin ( was otherwis invit regular to comment on polit event by the televis channel `` russia today '' ) , and the terrorist movement of hizbollah and hama , he want britain to abandon nuclear weapon and emerg from nato and the eu .
for corbyn , who consid the kill of osama bin laden as a real tragedi , isi is almost prefer to the unit state .
after the pattern of all populist demagogu , corbyn has , of cours , miracul anti-auster solut .
thing of the kind that they were say and promis and tsipra in greec until the time he gave the chest to the real world and econom legal .
the econom programm of the new labour leader provid , among other thing , massiv renationalis and money print as a solut to financ develop project and cover veri generous social benefit .
sure , some might wonder whi the solut with the print of money is not unanim adopt across the globe , we would then have a global general prosper ! , but who would no longer prevent such detail .
of cours , we can charg the blood on banker , you becom a kind of enemi of power of the left , but as far as it has been seen so mani time in the past , not onli in the former communist state or in ecuador or venezuela , but also in franc , at the begin of the term of jason and holland .
the extra sum are quick swallow by generous , no-cov promis made by populist demagogu .
as margaret thatcher point out , `` the issu of social is that at one point the money of other end . ''
few give real chanc to jeremi corbyn to ever get the prime minist .
in the earli 1980s , anoth radic left-w leader , michael foot , who anyway was n't as extrem in belief as the parti 's new leader , fail miser in the elect .
and then there is still in britain a work class , in the classic sens of the word , relat consist and structur .
and the union were more influenti than now .
under the new industri landscap , where servic are domin in the workforc , and extens automak have made the industri a massiv need for high-skil work hand , corbyn 's rhetor has a limit call .
but even from the opposit , he can influenc import develop that can affect us direct .
in it latest financi time , the elect of corbyn increas the chanc of brexit , and britain 's exit from the eu .
the new labour leader has been a consist oppon of the countri 's membership in the union .
in the eye of the radic left brussel is the agent of intern capit and a promot of globalis that has impos the auster of the poor .
when combat this kind of idea with those express by the radic right , with anti-immigr rhetor and you look at the refuge crisi that rock the eu , you reach an explos mix .
and not just for britain .
but if the british decid in the wake of the referendum , which would be held by 2017 , to leav the union loss of symbol capit for the entir european project and the deep tremor creat insid it by the euro crisi and now that is whi refuge , between north and south , between east and west , leav room for scenario of the most worri .
all the more so as for a whole seri of member state , london was a counterpoint to the franco-german axi ( in which berlin is increas becom the domin player ) .
true , the british busi environ , the citi , are strong lawyer for the countri 's remain in the eu .
but today 's europ is no longer the one in the past .
there are mani resent , rise in intens even in those week .
the problem is that brussel , we even recent had a specimen in the speech by jean cluj by junker , is increas inclin to make major decis over the head of the vast major of member state , with onli a few european power , main with germani .
and that 's when elector support for anti-system , anti-immigr format that are at the same time and euroscept is grow dramat across the contin .
in other word , the emot climat with negat cargo has reach higher rate than ever in the past .
where and the conclus the financi time draw when assess brexit 's chanc .
the pro-eu option is base on a cold calcul that leav the nation interest .
if voter make the decis , then britain will remain in the eu .
but corbyn 's victori remind us of the power of emot in the current polici .
howev , eastern europ can be signific affect by such major develop .
especi if , as expect , we will see more pronounc integr of the euro area , which will push most of the state in the region and the peripheri of the interest and to that of the decision-mak process in europ .
corbyn , tsipra and syriza in greec , podemo in spain , even berni sander in the unit state are feed their populist rhetor from the frustrat accumul in oocious societi .
from econom and demograph caus , the prosper enjoy over the last decad , generous social benefit , can no longer continu the same way in the come year .
under the explos pressur of the dual crisi , the euro area - immigr , both caus by hasti decis that have not taken into account than the integrationist polit ambit , not the abil and readi of peopl and govern in europ to respond to such challeng , the turbul on the contin , intern tension in the eu will increas in intens and damag romania 's situat .
and it 's hard to dismiss someth from the point of view of possibl scenario .
the question is whether our main polit leader are abl to deal with such complic situat .
constantin brancusi , sept .
rockefel : `` how can i help you ? ''
brancusi : `` take and matur the workshop ! ''
the great sculptor had a great dream : to be someon , to get famous , to hear about him all over the world .
behind the recount , howev , is someth almost forgotten today , when million of success stori are deliv , recip for success in life .
that someth also has a name .
it is call `` truddl . ''

and when it come out of the lad , he hear the follow instruct : `` we go to the park , at brancuand . ''
the countri is crowd with it statuett .
there are few romanian person whose work are known by the same world , from children , to the elder .
brancusi 's infiltr capac is a huge one .
neither the communist manag to excel romania 's memori and cultur .
it cité are today line up the internet , receiv hundr of thousand of smes and smes .
and then again , what would he actual be to say about this man ?
seen from the pile of book and articl tri to recreat their destini , brancusi 's life look almost fantast , total unlik .
you know , i 'm those peopl who tell you that if you did n't have the luck to play in ani big citi and in a famili as much as you can , your chanc of success in life are almost nil .
brancusi 's life is the perfect counterexampl .
and mayb that 's where it would be a key .
perhap the text that is come from here should be start .
with a sentenc , howev palat they are .
use the success stori of the creatur , which will be deliv daili in newspap and on tv .
watch the figur of this man care .
do you know how to succeed in life , how , today , has he heard a whole world ?
it is simpl .
he has work all life to be someon .
that 's what he did .
constantin brancusi is born on 19 februari 1876 in hobita , a small villag in the common pestisani , gorj counti , at the foot of the carpathian .
it is the fifth child of maria and radu nicola brancusi .
although it came from a famili of wealthi peasant , brancusi take a modest life , but one of which he had to reap his repertoir will guid her late-stori vision .
recal his childhood and the place where she grew up , the artist had to confess , in a meet with petr tutea , from pari , from 1933 : `` on then life was beauti and harmoni . ''
for millennia , peopl were move , happi , a patriarch life .
it was all cross from one season to anoth .
and do you know whi thing have chang ?
the fascin of the great citi has come to us .
brancusi 's copilaria , howev , was far from an idyl one .
one of the moment spent in these year of life is high indic of the combin of puriti and violenc that characteris the futur sculptor year in his nativ countri .
the moment is reproduc in the `` brancusi , '' a biographi , `` written by alexand bujar .
in 1879 , constantin brancusi had 3 year .
in the autumn of that year , when the tube was made `` at the bronco , '' watch those who sampl the liquid to see if the process unfold as they need , brancusi catch a moment of general unconsci .
they fill their cascad with tube and drink on the nerv .
it fall in sleep almost instant .
the first peopl onli notic after a few minut .
the mother enter the panic , then in hysteria , believ that the son had die .
toward the even , when the father , radu , return from live accompani by laut , he see the desper sign of those who eager await him in his mouth .
the parti is immedi turn into jale .
the father is alreadi think about hull .
howev , someon find that it is well base on baba brandusa , the sheep and serv of brancer .
brandusa check the babi 's breath , then put him under the bouquet of hors , gather from the pub .
the babi is strong .
the world applaud .
as the boy is left to sleep over the beast , of joy , the parti with lens continu with even more forc .
the second day , father and son meet through orchard .
radu brancusi put constantin to collect some nude and bring them up .
the father captur her babi with her head down and , with the nuanc brought by the boy , is knock him out to keep her mind .
and while it feel the garment of blow , the small brancuand has the revel that the world can also be seen from anoth perspect and that thing around can come down .
especi the sun 's posit , differ from the well-known one , make him wonder , as he had to admit in old age , if not the blue himself take part in the disturb .
would the sun have been as disturb as his father of what happen to him ? ``
