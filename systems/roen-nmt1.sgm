<seg id="1">UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UN chief has again called on all sides, including the divided UN Security Council to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this difficult situation."</seg>
<seg id="6">Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 figures in polls showing Donald Trump has real chances</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him as a "fridge-flop" politician.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others called him a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And others await the implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to remove Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some are starting to question seriously what this means for the chances of the real estate mogul's appointment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still premature.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republicans' nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's lead was taking place to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the reasons why it would struggle hard at the general election are numerous.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth acknowledge Trump's power and are starting to support him with money.</seg>
<seg id="12">We continue to present some figures from recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something passing:</seg>
<seg id="13">Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, in mid-June, a poll by the University of Monmouth shows that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those numbers remain.</seg>
<seg id="20">A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a poll conducted by CNN / ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump would win the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be "excited" about 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">Closest to the excitement?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, with just 21 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unhappy" or "upset" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the nomination race.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to ABC News / Washington Post's poll on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Kings are the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44 per cent say he doesn't have the personality needed to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament does not have what he is looking for at the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are enjoying the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to a CNN / ORC poll last week, at the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="35">The situation changed to the end of July when four out of 10 would have gambled on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full information: In the past, GOP voters didn't read the future very well.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race, versus only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">But these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans or replay for another candidate, Trump is still at the top of all.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to Trump's victory, while prop Donald Trump will split up to more than a dozen candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">Trump is at the distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, at 15 points of Walker, at 19 points at Jeb Bush and finally, at 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.</seg>
<seg id="43">He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one showdown.</seg>
<seg id="46">Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have decided.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don't change their voting option.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, much can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 per cent say it leaves the window open to the possibility of changing their choice.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, Trump's most important contender is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign's opening speech two months ago, immigration was the focus of the 2016 campaign.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are Instagram that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent evangelical voters and the Republican Party and will harm the Lib Dems.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the ABC / Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="55">The ASA, however, seems as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the authorities is reaching new cull.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely thanks to their status of outfits.</seg>
<seg id="58">According to the ABC / Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government.</seg>
<seg id="59">People are also upset by Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Sharks / Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the leaders of the Republicans in the congress, with 54 per cent declaring themselves "unhappy" and 21 per cent "nervous and cull."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister 's</seg>
<seg id="2">Ever since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has long been expected</seg>
<seg id="3">Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister 's', facing the first time with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts."</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said he can drop a few extras and give them to his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep quiet at the rosse of the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the England battle drew criticism from conservative MPs and held the front page of the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept quiet respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of British air forces in the Battle of England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Chapo 's Newsnight that it would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "no matter" of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Around a dozen ministers from the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences "get stuck" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his position towards the European Union and the benefits limit.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring changes to which it would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, Labour and Pennings Minister, said the party "is very clear" in exclusive opposition to government plans to cut the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron on the floor in the last decade since he took the helm of the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from foreign sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">MP Islington North said PMQs involve a level of confrontation too high and that it would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would hold her seat at PMQs when he can't attend - for example when Mr Cameron moves abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he approached House of Deputies Speaker John Berkeley to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted several years later that he had failed in his work.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, of how he heads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say he has become a caricature and that he needs deep reform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented dude often called "Special KS," has been dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous knee injury that Kyrgios had with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to beat Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after whom Harrison said: "The Eagles should have put him to the knees of Kyrgios, and I should have put him on the footy."</seg>
<seg id="6">Although he was last seen making a powder after he had cramps and missed a possible U.S. Open, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was vigorously defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow where he is battling Sam Groth for second spot after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a bit in the conflict," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the crampe in the U.S., but he is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration towards himself and I know Thanasi enough to know that they wouldn't be proud of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">But let's be serious, he has mastered extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has an extraordinary team, he has a great family alongside and I think he was treated unfairly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, he hasn't had any clash with the other players, he's very respected at the Broncos, he trains hard, he's in excellent form, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and faults.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the key replay game, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suited to all, but he supported the return of the player originally from Canberra in the long run in the team.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the replay game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick has climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's matured under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised, but we're trying to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his deeds and I think he needs a while not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, good thing for both the team and him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has shrunk to half in national polls</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure advantage in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton is now backed by 47 per cent of Democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 per cent of Democratic voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">With at least five months before the start of the primary election, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more decisive in their choice than supporters of other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Against the poll conducted by CBS News last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has dwindled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Support among men has narrowed considerably and Sanders is at a distance of just 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton is still in the edge among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton stands in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was elected to run on behalf of the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would argue it somewhat reserved, and another 15 per cent would only support it because it represents the party.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters are excited about her choice is high.</seg>
<seg id="17">Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-placed, Donald Trump (35 per cent) is lower.</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="21">The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">With the vice president considering a possible presidential bid, 57 per cent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he shouldn't run.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the question of the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters call him a majority Biden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders is growing, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he is not running.</seg>
<seg id="26">55 per cent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the highest chance to win the general election; but the numbers have fallen from 78 per cent as they were last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is at the distance of the second, but the percentage that he is most eligible has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer the issues instead of eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in a few key features to their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Most voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integral and trustworthy and with solid leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">30 percent of Democratic voters don't think H. Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent don't have a view of him on that.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters also believe in general that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.</seg>
<seg id="35">On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have a view of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">How questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a message by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are happy with her explanation on the subject and say she has not affected her general opinion on the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="37">But things are different among the American public.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now unhappy with their explanation, while only nearly a third are happy.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion split in March on the subject shortly after the issue came out.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say that the controversy over the email has not affected the general opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say they have changed their mind in negative sense.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their mind about Clinton in negative sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">While Democratic voters consider Clinton mainstream and trustworthy, this issue continues to raise concerns among voters at the general level: Only 32 per cent consider it to be integrated and trustworthy, with 8 per cent fewer than last month and 15 per cent fewer than in May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of voters do not see it as reliable and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 per cent of voters at national level do not see Trump as trustworthy and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, both Clinton and Trump have been white for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.</seg>
<seg id="47">The number of those who see Sanders is bigger than those who disagree, though, as in Carson's case, many don't have a view of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 51 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five gang members charged over murder of student in Year 1 at Barbour faculty</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity at the New York Faculty of Baruch brutally attacked the chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.</seg>
<seg id="4">Official sources say the victim was linked to the eye, was put in the back of a 14-kg backpack filled with sand and was handcuffed repeatedly while trying to head towards a target, on a frozen ground.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng charged headaches after losing consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the PPI Delta PSI did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.</seg>
<seg id="7">But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the fraternity at national level, to ask her advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and effectively put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trending and couch.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost their lives every year due to rituals," Douglas Blackberg, the lawyer for Deng's family, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">The brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and this measure taken by the authorities is important.</seg>
<seg id="13">The grand jury of the Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of degree three.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two vertebrates of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for unconscious and abetting murder.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to draw responsibility not only to the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the Brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also draw it to account," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch faculty banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will happen when the Fed raises interest rate</seg>
<seg id="2">The interest rate will rise and the Bull market (rising market) will sink, bond profitability will rise and the economy will fall into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is what we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the economy, history offers few clues on the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The federal Reserve's aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets have responded.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why the central bank officials in the US have so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on the moment when it starts to raise interest rates but on the trajectories of the time needed for normalisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in the end, market players could find that all the hype over the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to customers.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal but still small levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">We continue to present the way in which several sectors of the economy could react, relying on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">Given the situation that the market has experienced in recent months, anticipation of an interest rate hike may have wiped out a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">But at the time the impact is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It seems that there is a tendency for capital profitability to falter for 12-24 months after the first increase, which reflects once again the defect in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey on what would happen after Fed increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards an interest rate rise, rather flammable in the 250-day period after (an average of 2.6 per cent) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on shares tend to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and benefits start to fall.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recession is a reality of economic life, but interest rate hikes often contribute to it.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current situation, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Specifically, gross domestic product will close to its historic minimum point for an increase in the Fed's interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even if the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market players have been preparing all the year for a Fed growth decision, with all eyes glued to this week's meeting of the Federal Trade Market Commission, which closes on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Although many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase during this meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of just 25 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our survey conducted after 1950, all the rates of interest rate growth to date were in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP propagating the peaks ahead of the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the contrary, this has been a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest-awaited Fed since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income has also been volatile since the market predicts an interest rate rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact is faster in the bond case than in the case of actions when the Fed amends policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the bond case, it seems that the benefits are changing the direction as soon as the first growth / drop in the cycle occurs.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond profitability is falling immediately, "Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Strategies Charles Schwab believe that these interest rate increases will determine the return of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, driving the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-quality decorations are doing better in such an environment, although "we are still wary of forcing profitability," said in an analysis Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Besides the strength of the dollar and the estimated disinflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, Curba profitability is more right, the average mortgage interest rate rise has expanded and volatility has increased - all the market's characteristics when Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Broadly, companies operating in the US will benefit from an interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Large debts with high debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the increase in their products into the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Firms with strong balance sheets surpassed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital revenues and low-volatility stocks also surpassed similar-quality companies with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will become an important issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.</seg>
<seg id="47">Consumers will also benefit from rising the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Those who save may also have to gain, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy after CFM, says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Tory MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station because 'silly'</seg>
<seg id="3">It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial challenger</seg>
<seg id="4">He also took to the BBC Music Awards, saying they were chasing the Brits Awards</seg>
<seg id="5">Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying this show was not original</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" QFM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tory MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station "silly is" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I have the impression that Radio 3" silly is "- although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into CFM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also took to the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.</seg>
<seg id="10">BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is much in front of its commercial rival on live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">I'm not going to be anywhere about classical music dating from Radio 3.</seg>
<seg id="14">And his commitment to live music and production does not have a rival.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In addition, I think it is also important for Radio 3's commitment to discover new music and the allocation of new pieces," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to draw the audience from the previous period because Britons have fewer knowledge of classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised at the meeting of the culture, media and sports committee because it would go on the trail of its trading rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you understand why there are often discussions about the issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself through anything?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted the show by BC1 - starring Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - would be made "in a specific BBC manner."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the corporation "to find the chicken egg in its own house" next time it launches an entertainment show.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he declined to ban on the future of taking new seasons from The Voice or spending the money that goes on licences on other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales recorded the lowest increase in August and the culprit could be Black.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015, online sales rose 7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past month, it has been the slowest growth since 2000.</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales took off three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phone to make shopping.</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the Black Sea Eagles in November could determine the reluctance to spend.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">But specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The total money spent in August presented the lowest growth in 2000 to date, with an increase of just 5 per cent over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using the mobile phone to shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it increased the number of people who were able to shop online and could do it in diverse circumstances, such as from canapea.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now that a little standstill, you could see a drop (growth).</seg>
<seg id="14">The phenomenon of the Black Sea, imported from America, is listed as one of the reasons for falling sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the specialists' view, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event that takes place in the last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to put hands on offer, which led to the crash of several retailers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Specialists believe that Black Friday, when shoppers beat bargains, could prompt buyers' reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study published by British Retail Consortium has determined that at least 1 inch of every $5 is spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently carried out via online stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.</seg>

<seg id="1">After punishing the Bin Laden family, Muslims are the victims of the victims killed in the wake of the collapse of Sinjar in Mecca</seg>
<seg id="2">The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walking on the streets of Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant, Binladin Group for the breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the cranes</seg>
<seg id="5">In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed shell at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed in white, those who were crying dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at Al-Moorem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad memory preserved by the holy site, where only a few days ago collapsed a building machete through the tavern, falling to the faithful.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for the funeral after the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the ceremony in the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed shell at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.</seg>
<seg id="10">The victims included the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the cranes collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram is in the UK with his parents prior to the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi authorities have already pledged that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims coming to the city further.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the group of Binladin should not have left the arm of high cranes when the machete was not in operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the group Binladin partially bears blame for the crash.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English service did not show the specifics, but said the company's leaders were given a ban to leave the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week, Salman had vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the cranes in the court of Britain's Moskeys, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group of Binladin has not yet made statements about the collapse of the cranes, and the group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.</seg>
<seg id="18">The royal decree blamed the group because it has not used up-to-date safety measures and has not coordinated its work with the weather authorities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive building effort led by the Bladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">For decades, the Bladin family has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and runs major construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">The last Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "disowned" son, disinherited by the family in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prabuba has come under strong wind and rain conditions, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is essential at least once in the lives of each Muslim physically fit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Authorities have decided that relatives of the dead victims would receive a million Saudi Rials (£174,000) and the same amount to pay those with permanent injuries.</seg>
<seg id="25">Other injured will get half of that amount.</seg>

<seg id="1">Advantages and disadvantages of Swiss franc loan conversion</seg>
<seg id="2">In the banking market, two offers of cash conversion in the Swiss franc have already emerged, with the main advantages being excluding currency risk and cutting rates.</seg>
<seg id="3">The disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Transylvania Bank has just finished the process on the conversion of loans to francs granted by Volkbank, and the Post Bank announced the conversion offer for its own customers.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to data compiled by analysts of the Financial portal Finzoom, the Post Bank offers three years of fixed interest to lions, 1.5 per cent, the lowest on the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83 per cent of credit customers in the franc thanks to two successive cuts: It has narrowed solitude with the value of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then applied an extra 22.5 per cent to solitude in the lions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how they pay monthly equivalent in the lions before the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, the Bank of Transylvania is reducing the rate by 42.5% and the Post Bank, with 33% in the first three years and, in theory, 18% over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Benefits</seg>
<seg id="10">The main advantage of the redemption of credit in CHF is that the currency risk is being removed, with the consumer being protected by the future increases in the franchise, and repayment will be made in the currency in which it collects its salary.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of the property is made, no additional guarantees and other income proof are required.</seg>
<seg id="12">In practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will it be additional costs as in the case of a refunding.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both banks also offer a cut to the monthly rate, compared to how customers pay before the conversion, equivalent to the lions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Risks</seg>
<seg id="15">The problem is that the rate in the first few years is made up of interest, and the customer is repaying very little from the main.</seg>
<seg id="16">The low-interest Post's offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is unclear, however, how this interest will evolve after three years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25 per cent, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.</seg>
<seg id="19">A possible risk for all loans in variable-rate lions is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly over the next few years (more than the Libor index - CHF).</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, ROBOR to three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013, at 6%, in 2009, at more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008, it exceeded 40%!</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, it is possible to defend other costs, too, in the initial offer.</seg>

<seg id="1">The timing of interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">The world is looking at its scheduled meeting in two days on Wednesday and Thursday when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not interest rates for the first time in about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a Reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed brought rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time, we face a situation where a major central bank could drop zero rates and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low inflation level.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the Fed must not ignore the less rosy global situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20: 00 CET.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manchester United player Luke Shaw sits on the bar several months due to double fractures.</seg>
<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double bogey in his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the event that brought him tears to the player's eyes and holding him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play the season again.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury occurred following a reckless intervention from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defence.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was given medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double-foot fractures and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after then it will be operated in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he had 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now that's something like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the vagina he was put into the oxygen mask.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plangea.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor, but a double replay is six months old and will not play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he can play this season again.</seg>

<seg id="14">Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge alone when they say it's a foul and red card.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very ugly meditation, with two legs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth has clearly risked the omission of England but is still standing up</seg>
<seg id="2">The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, having seen the team selected by England for the tournament, they are not considering a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Test matches.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not eliminate the variant of a race victory either.</seg>
<seg id="4">Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but he has good players on thorn in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events in 2012 but will have a positive positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali is evolving as spider and Adil Rashid, even if it's unknown at the level of testing, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related subjects: Adam Lyth left England team for Test matches and was replaced by Alex Helected</seg>
<seg id="7">Obviously as his main coach in Yorkshire, it's difficult to look at the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the squad.</seg>
<seg id="8">He played the seven Test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after the results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that previously - the players are their own selection.</seg>
<seg id="10">Any fifty years, and perhaps Lyth would have extended his temper, but his destiny is in his hands.</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope that if it makes more iPhones for Yorkshire it will have some other opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="12">England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when Spotify wasn't on the measure of his ability and it doesn't surprise me that; first of all, he's a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the Test matches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven tweets - like Sam Robson ahead of him - while Nick Compton had nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton had luck at home and travelling.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only complaint you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the team comes Alex Helected, a batsman I'm bowling very well.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a cricket player who has the "X Factor" and which I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a Trent Champion.</seg>
<seg id="19">It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen was launched to open up with Cook, which would lead extra spacecraft while keeping four bucks, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a punter couldn't hit there and this left-hander has already shown he's given naibies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but he was No 3 for them, so the difference is not great.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches 38 as the Sharks before entering the open in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He wiped out three centuries away and didn't look behind.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Anjump comes to the team on the post-up spider post and although I've had limited contact with him, it struck me that he's a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People might judge the early age - with an average of 31 to beating and 35 on the ball - and they might think it's a punt, but there's no bunch of nests and the selection opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's going to learn a lot from this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="28">England have brought some changes to the coaching team as well.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a headmaster.</seg>
<seg id="30">He's one of the best players and he will bring a lot of experience, given he played in any situation and against all sorts of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes for the White Bowl of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuitive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes, the new voices in the vestiar, even if they transmit messages that have been passed and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">Colly Durham's teammates Ben Stokes rest for one-day matches, Root has got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">While I don't all agree, coaches and coaches do not do the program.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to note, players' jobs depend on the results they get.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are never made easy.</seg>

<seg id="2">As it passes, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain into the EU is getting deeper into the mess, even without the selection of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or not?" Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TTIP brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Fargo.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat explained last days that - submerged in similar crises with the one in the EU - not all of them being made domestic - some Member States are fed up with Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided they didn't want it if they erode social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it the "selfies" agenda of Dave and George.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, make a poise in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have gained allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's just about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with the prospect of outside under the roof of the EU - "We don't let ourselves with France," Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and short-sighted officials from some capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, the highly cautious German Chancellor, is an ally but has stood at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clicked, how it happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who sat too much.</seg>

<seg id="13">Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's hard to believe they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some ministers may even be planning remarks that do not help, in the SNP's style, in the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my mum suggests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain didn't get anything of value from renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know on their skin how lively it can be, and how sceptical they are from the oligarch media who view the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">He can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ed Miliband knew his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included the mixture to find non-payers, foreigners who defrauded the phone and pseudo-Domi who hold most of the key newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair is seeing him a little bit, but he realised that when Ed is locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a exit card.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has not forgiven him for that either.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Jeremy Corbyn, who struck me girlfriend in the back on Monday at Westminster - told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be at risk to take the Murdoch strategy to boycott Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It can last, but it has to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her holiday on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most of those who disagree with the Tories "anglicism could agree to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">That's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Benn" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as the "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">He reminded me of the 1970s when his father struggled on TV to be unfair to Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his office in the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's fight was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the fight to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at the private meeting on Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - note, it also made me aware of me - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television, and especially in the pool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right not to give Cameron a ticket to favour in Europe, allowing him to take good support for Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell's basic driving and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a heated discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the feminism of small differences is a central dogma.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his leadership on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be compelled to try to understand.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin become political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Tory government cutting costs, as I was reminded of the launch of British Foreign Affairs Forum on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Specialists criticize Public Health Department's decision in England on electronic cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted in a meeting between 12 people, some of which are linked to the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists from the British Medical Journal's editorial team (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the Public Health Department of England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "landmark" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">Several researchers, however, questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An article published last month in the Lancet medical magazine attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" he founded on the main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned the claims and set them "on solid soil or on the sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, a European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said they expected the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.</seg>
<seg id="10">In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the drawing up of a multi-pronged decision-analysis model (MCDA) that would summarise their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which the executive director said would have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past year to conduct an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">It also validated BAT's accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding that there were reports that they would have received it from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.</seg>
<seg id="14">The arguments have not been provided on the basis of which members of the table have been selected, but among them are a few 'rainbows' known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say in the work of industry funding.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other participants at the meeting are not known for the expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The head of the tobacco control station in PHE also attended the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research paper drafted by the group "convincingly whitewashed" the fact that there is a lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, there is no mention of any of these links or limitations in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said Ms E's claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the CFE health department, says he has responded in the past to claims in BMJ.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic marijuana is significantly less harmful than smoking"</seg>
<seg id="22">One in two people who smoked all life is losing their lives because of this vice.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is minor compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those that do not stem from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers relative to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Annually, some 880,000 people lose their lives due to a disease associated with smoking, and the annual costs incurred by the NHS due to smoking reach £2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is clear to the current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.</seg>

<seg id="9">Related news: U.S. arms fair: Authoritarian regimes arrive in London</seg>

<seg id="12">In September of this year, a lot of weaponry dealers will bounce back on DHS customers are required to help stop the Weapons Fair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 300 posters are carried out by artists who exhibited works at the Mel Depot Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.</seg>
<seg id="14">A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Pain," a 6-pound package Allen said it "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations on the planet."</seg>

<seg id="21">VCCP's director of creation, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around advertising for the arms fair - with a empty space in the Manhattan calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They were playing with making a more realistic advert, but "enriching it with loud animations and colours, it was more striking."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They have done a great job to help us increase the interest in selling illegal torture equipment within the Fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now, it would require the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's been 11 years since I moved to Camin, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in Berete and moral dexterity, but only now I remember the forced smiles of those that I annoy - and the many complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of the things I learned can be summarised in the form of eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving to Camin can bring stats that range from nervously to horror.</seg>
<seg id="5">Palaszczuk is tempting: To tell people of where you live, if and where you've spent a year of a break from studies, what you think of Corbyn and why "honestly, Iti is no stranger because, on good boys, it's nothing other than the yeah, you find me in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Re-pirate deep.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others breathe - put questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">They Anima the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like with which you wouldn't stand by either if the Broncos were coming, and they would be the only ones who would have boats.</seg>
<seg id="9">Don't suffocate people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Campers often abound with drinks parties, film evenings and social networking meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and probate their injunction.</seg>
<seg id="11">Similar subjects: You don't even think of starting student life in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">The intruders have special treatment at university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your sleep should be a refuge, but in many homes it is building a culture of percussion through bedrooms, based on friendship, social networking and friends that take all life.</seg>
<seg id="14">All of this can be awful for someone trying to load their batteries.</seg>
<seg id="15">None of this culture doesn't allow me to say, "Te I like, and I want to stay friends but I want to plank to recover my energy that I consumed interacting with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to listen when a colleague is stretchered by social media - and try to send an SMS instead of batting at the door.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's gonna go to the door: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy who sat in the same Camin with me had a policy that said if a door was not incubators, then he was invited to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">He has seen enough.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends cook.</seg>
<seg id="21">Given that you start the university in Bake-off-off, if you're knocking on someone's door to make awareness and go and a plate with negativity, it seems less strange, less of the situation in the 1950s, "welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something, now smile and I'm putting personal questions."</seg>

<seg id="31">Now he's in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You don't make noise that doesn't let others sleep or study.</seg>
<seg id="33">That's not just because you're looking for good sense, but because you're going on your own on the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="34">A student girl with me asked her neighbour to give music more slowly because it was about 3 morning and had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">Their reaction was to give the music louder.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they stopped the music in a final at 5am on Monday morning, the girl was amable and left her to sleep two hours before giving the way to the top of the music, circled the door and left for the three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband / future wife would move on the same palliative?</seg>
<seg id="38">On the contrary, it would not be extremely strange if you have confused me a colleague of palliative with your future husband, you have joined you, and you should meet you on a daily basis, and perhaps even see how they are taking up all common friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, you can't resist the injunction - but if a colleague sexy of minder certainly isn't your future husband, you're even trying to be rational.</seg>

<seg id="1">Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no world tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beethoven, Brahms, Barbour, Enescu were people who were working, artists and not commercial representatives.</seg>
<seg id="3">French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as solitary but also as initiator of a less ordinary project, downright "weird," as he even says, Les Dissonoo - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians, who performs a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.</seg>
<seg id="4">Les Dissonoo was this year at the Billboard Festival with two performances: A performance, on Sunday, in which solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the front-runner Xavier Phillips was located in the foreground, with the co-operative artwork being unfazed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both performances, conducted on the Athenian stage, have shown the public a different kind of classical music.</seg>
<seg id="6">Les Dissonoo appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classic musical ensemble where there is no conductor.</seg>
<seg id="7">The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is true, on the one hand, the musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, rather than composers.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are trained as "specialist workers."</seg>
<seg id="10">They themselves have the impression they need a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the feisty musical is focused on conductor.</seg>
<seg id="12">And so the genre, the music industry, is doing its marketing.</seg>
<seg id="13">So we're not talking about music anymore.</seg>
<seg id="14">So if you look at this world, we have some skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public that can't listen, but they have to look, which is stupid, "says David Grimal.</seg>
<seg id="15">The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came in the wake of his "musical deception" from her solitary career.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.</seg>
<seg id="17">10 years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because we did not find the creativity and the Human fraternity in this system.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I've never found any sense of continuing on this road.</seg>
<seg id="19">So I decided to create Les Dissonoo.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's in 2004, and at the time no one was doing so without a conductor: "The music world, highly conservative, didn't want such projects."</seg>
<seg id="21">"How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" The artist asks.</seg>
<seg id="22">David Grimshaw acknowledges that Les Dissonar is "a luxury," adding that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a stumbling block in the song act: "Curiously, the more complex repertoire we play, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are required to be present in the opera and not only in the role," Grimal says, adding that on Sunday's show "I was 74 conductors on stage."</seg>
<seg id="24">In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, precisely because it also invited Les Dissonoo: "An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these guest orchestras and this strange group."</seg>
<seg id="25">In a temple of the orchestra tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Speaking about the opera of Enescu, the violinist admits he feels Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he didn't need a special approach when he introduced works of his hand in his repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="27">Grimal notes that Mason's music is very instinctive, but that's when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who has made French music."</seg>
<seg id="28">Grimshaw campaigns to change the way classical musical education is made, believing that "the musician's profession, as it is organised today, has a quiz of death" and that "the future of music is music itself."</seg>
<seg id="29">We do not need to tour the world 5 times a year if it does not serve to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="30">In Bach's era there were no world tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beethoven, Brahms, Barbour, Enescu were people who were working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.</seg>
<seg id="32">For me, organising concerts, festivals, tours, the launch of albumes, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they do in the music service.</seg>
<seg id="33">If we do not, we are in a system where creativity is suffering, no longer has freedom.</seg>
<seg id="34">To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave example to Romanian products before and post membership in the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter the EU, you have good vegetables and meat."</seg>
<seg id="35">To enter the EU we had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.</seg>
<seg id="36">Production and agriculture reach the supermarket service, as is also the case in France.</seg>
<seg id="37">With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.</seg>
<seg id="38">Les Dissonoo makes tomatoes perhaps not too nice, but when you cut them are true tomatoes.</seg>
<seg id="39">In an ideal world, it should be for this music to return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done from educational policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If we thought - as the Koreans do, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of humanity's most beautiful things, we would reintroduce learning to school, re-introduce concerts on TV and through this education there would be no need to sell musical products," Grimal believes.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are certainly things in classical music education that remain very Communist, that's everywhere, it's something very militarised.</seg>
<seg id="42">It depends on this discipline if you compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will perform at a tool, and, first of all, musician.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are talking about a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's all something else.</seg>
<seg id="44">After your hair, what's more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "Asks the French artist smiling.</seg>
<seg id="45">Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from overcoming this status of "soldier," overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert I come out smiling."</seg>
<seg id="46">David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist as part of the "Festival of ideas," a discussion with the public at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.</seg>
<seg id="47">Profile David Grimal</seg>
<seg id="48">After following the National Super Bowl de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, the period in which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ie des Science School in Paris ahead of their meeting with Philippe Hshhorn, who changed his course of life.</seg>
<seg id="49">David Grimshaw has an international career of solo violinist, along which he has regularly performed concerts over the past 20 years on the world's leading classical music scenes and prestigious orchestras such as Anre de Paris, Zore Philechique de Radio France, The National Orchestra, the Bolshre National of Lyon, the New Japan-based Orchestra, the Dure de l'Opera de Lyon, the New Japan-based Symphony Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonia Warsaw, under the leadership of conductors such as Guardians, Michel Champion, Michael Schappnstead, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruters hound by Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Neuffin, Christian Arming.</seg>

<seg id="51">In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal has kept exploring more personal projects as well.</seg>
<seg id="52">The freedom she gave her collaboration with Les Dissonoo allowed him to develop his inner universe by adventurous in the repertoire that isn't accessible to solo artists.</seg>
<seg id="53">Along with Les Dissonoo, set up "L'Autre Saison," a series of concerts in the benefit and together with homeless people at the Saint-lion church, in the heart of Paris.</seg>

<seg id="3">Do you have a super talented and spontaneous kid who likes the films?</seg>
<seg id="4">Give him the chance to get the star.</seg>
<seg id="5">In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to get future stars and who have between 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for the "small Voices of Great," giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.</seg>
<seg id="6">If in the classic disposals, the focus is on bringing the actor's voice to the cartoon character, in the last period, to the creation of the story and those who are expected to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cinema City, however, wants to discover new voices, and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.</seg>
<seg id="8">We want to find the right voice and cause parents to score their children at our contest.</seg>
<seg id="9">They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathies and hugs are fun.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Children will have fun and will have a real chance of being part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the first stage of the contest, from 11 September to 30 September, Cinema City is organising a shortlist that will be chosen by 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the chance to perform in a recording studio alongside professionals.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the parents need to do is access the micillaimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to score the child in the contest and prepare it for the voice test.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx Cups are mixed, drops fiscal forecasts for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx has declared disappointing results for the quarter, with gas giant cutting profit estimates for all year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the same period last year, FedEx announced it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company's shares fell about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell bell.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 dollars for the fiscal year ending in May next year, up 20 cents lower, according to a previous estimate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected to have $10.84 dollars, according to a survey by Fairfax Media.</seg>
<seg id="8">The falling estimate comes despite rising prices by 4.9 per cent on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overcharging for land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply since November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it is still expected to increase earnings from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.</seg>
<seg id="10">President and Director-General Fred Smith said "the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hiring plans during the holiday period were announced a day after the UPS contestant said he planned to hire 990,000-95,000 extra workers, about the same number of workers he made last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The shares per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zack Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Profit rose 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts who participated in the Zafestible poll of $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit in recent years of a decline in international priority shipments, leading to the stagnation of revenue recorded by its Express unit.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the explosion in online shopping has salted the results of the FedEx Cup division.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, the revenues of the global division rose by 29%, but operating revenues have basically stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The U.S. unit recorded an increase in revenue thanks to higher base charges, while earnings recorded by the Fremantle division fell due to rising costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">On pre-market trading, about an hour before the start-up sound, FedEx shares were up 3.85 dollars or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, the closure fell 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent from the record maximum on June 11th.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the occasion of the most expected meeting in recent years, policymakers in the Fed will spend two days this week around a table of mahon Honduras with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Above them, at an end of the central bank's sitting room, a mural of the United States will be seen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed president, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above anything.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank has received a dual task from Congress: To maximise employment rates in the US and maintain price stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed there is a third unwritten task: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third task could be the X Factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dislocated by the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero interest rate in force since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most data points to a growing economy, recent turmoil on global financial markets may scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds - even with a percentage point of percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues they will follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage company Stigen Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to give them arguments to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will take, with this in itself causing instability in the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists polled recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate rise this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing the likelihood of growth is only 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates unless those who draw up policies would soften the blow by promising that it would take a long time to the next increase.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16.599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Aviva was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep the rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If Fed decision makers would do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts said an interest rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty over when the Fed would act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise rates by 0.25 per cent this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he was expecting an interest rate rise this year despite the objections raised by liberals how more economic progress would be needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">While job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pay rises have shown signs of growth.</seg>
<seg id="24">And while inflation has continued not to meet the central bank's annual target, Fed decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macrooo.</seg>
<seg id="26">But global financial markets began to enter the fiancée later this month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 per cent below the record maximum reached in May as investors feared slowing the Chinese economy would drag global growth down.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market slipped somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10 per cent below the maximum in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed decision makers, the market buzz is adding to the complex calculation of the interest rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about weakening the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more decisive in the sitting," said Stephen D. Onier, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he is expected to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and they almost have no data on which to later rely on events in China," Odom said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The eclipse of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so virtually it should not be considered in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.</seg>
<seg id="36">A mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" the monetary expansion triggered the earthquake on global markets.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly negative, it is expected that Fed officials are not only able to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Cowell, head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, Federal Reserve Bank president in Richmond, Viti., said this month that "Fed has a huge reaction track to changes in the financial market that appear not to be related to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a vote member of the Federal Committee on Open Market, the decision-making body, which advocated interest rate hikes, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite implications with limited identification possibility for US development," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials returned to the charges.</seg>
<seg id="43">The EDF should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">The last turbulent period is nowhere near the level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Certainly we don't want to get into the situation of afraid of an interest rate increase because they have upset the markets," Posen, chairman of the Institute for International Economics, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something is changed in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets in Nepal protesters</seg>
<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Violent occurred on Tuesday evening in the Shahandehi district, about 280km west of the U.S. capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Danielle Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after firing in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, according to him.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which they know can kill but usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the ethnic Madhesi group say the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on 10 August.</seg>
<seg id="11">When four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, the country ruled centrally for hundreds of years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The procedure for drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but legislators stepped up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.</seg>

<seg id="1">Weight reduction surgery could be useful in diabetes case with light obesity</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight reduction surgery in the case of easy obesity, with diabetes and type 2 diabetes may maintain for at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still premature to say whether diabetes with easy obesity is living longer after surgical intervention of weight loss than those following non-inflammatory treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A lot of time is needed to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, the CDC wrote an article about the new study in Julia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Surgery for weight loss, as well as bariatric surgery, uses different methods to lower the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have carried out on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IMC, a measure-measurement unit in the report, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.</seg>
<seg id="9">The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with the IMC over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your email accessory: 1,usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the collected data after 2007 in a dolphin that compares two types of barrier surgery - a gastric and gastert in Manson - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with easy obesity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average IMC to people who suffered surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the IMC to people who have received non-surgical treatments against cosmetic diabetes has remained close to the same level, which is 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of those who suffered surgical intervention, diabetic diabetes has completely healed at 36 per cent and in part to 28 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the group treated through medical methods, by comparison, cosmetic diabetes has completely healed at only 1% and partly to just 2% of the subjects.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, control of arterial tension, chimpanzees and LDL cholesterol "bad" cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, "the authors concluded.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showers also monitored the high level of hemoglobacter A1c, which reflects the level of glicking in time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Forecasters write that the optimal level of boutique A1c is below 7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobacter A1c fell from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in the group treated through medical methods, it stood at about 8 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this "glicemic control" improved - reflected by the improved levels of boutique A1c - did not reduce the death rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr Chih-Cheng, and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, compared to the group with Gastrections in Manson, the experienced surgical intervention group lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant falls in the IMC value (7.4 per cent to 5.1) and hemoglobacter A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and presented a higher probability of a complete remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on high-weight people in Sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says Blackstone, of Arizona University, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, the obese people who suffered stroke surgery showed a likelihood of about 29 per cent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">While the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who suffered surgical intervention, Blackstone said it was an upbeat aspect for people with the IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the point where this work is critical, because it says that this surgical intervention is safe in the low-billing group," without increasing the risk of death or renaline disease, she says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -taking weight seriously when the patient's prescription reaches 27-30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take that seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their circuits to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.</seg>

<seg id="5">He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the face of each nation's interests and even every continent.</seg>
<seg id="6">It also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is great care for several thousand refugees, but we also need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Under the anti-poisoning Centre in Georgia, US anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of about 400 per cent since 2010 in terms of the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed the antidepressant with high alcohol content.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the anti-poisoning Centre in Georgia, cases of the ingitis of the state of hands on children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poisoning centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them arrive at the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lopez said some children were intentionally drinking and others are doing it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">YouTube can be watched videos showing teenagers how they drink brightness to create cheap drinks.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teens are said to have blended the detergent with drinking water to get a bigger drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the mosquito.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child doesn't think he's doing harm," Lopez says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the most attractive types (of handsets of hands) are the perfume.</seg>
<seg id="11">Underwear with flavours of strawberries, grapes, Orange is the most attractive to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">The handbag contains about 45-95 per cent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially at small children, only a few swallowed up can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's very focused alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at the University Hospital in Kansas, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So we avoid leaving a glass of hot water on the table, but people leave these jaws of hands in affordable places and if the small ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume much alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who was recently ingested at the school equivalent of four sprays with a toothbrush with aroma of strawberries, reached the emergency room to receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Having an alcoholic 14179, twice the threshold to which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah Ballmajea and she could not go when she arrived at the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was terrifying," Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been fatal.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez advised Parinkers and teachers to use wet products or servings without alcohol and stop letting their hands-in-hand logos at the hands of the children.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two Ontario women passed away after they swallowed a handbag containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health authorities assumed the product contained methamphetamine, a lethal substance, rather than alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York were plotting to poison their "bad" teacher "putting antibacterial products into the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is very runner-up in his hands-on and banned him in his room for classes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police considered the plan "trivial" and filed the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.</seg>

<seg id="3">Hearts clash with SFA on Neilson's allegations and Warburton wary of January purchases that hurt team unity</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dons raise the difference from Celtic to five points</seg>
<seg id="5">Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half brought them from Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with the Dons scoring a five-point difference between them and Celtic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Griffiths demonises rumours of misunderstandings</seg>
<seg id="7">There have been rumours of discord in Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team were not subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">The absence of Scots in the race for the title trick is Dutch - de Boer</seg>
<seg id="10">The former midfielder of the Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - for not playing for the title with Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Boer, currently the ambassador of those at Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands we are no longer sending the summary of those from Celtic; why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they're not the Rangers there.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="14">He's talking about Fifty Shorm.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is talk of both teams together and there is an interest in the interest.</seg>
<seg id="16">The tension is high in matches in the Fifm League and not just Scots want to see those games.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'll change the situation, promises Deila.</seg>
<seg id="18">RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has vowed to change the situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Defeat with Malmo and subsequent elimination in the Champions League were followed by defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the standings with a five-point lead.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and they'll come back."</seg>
<seg id="21">We want to emerge as quickly as possible from this situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or trolling about what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="23">We also feel like us - but we need to go further.</seg>
<seg id="24">We necessarily need the support of those from Celtic because so the players are getting better.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is extremely important that we remain united now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Warburton's caution on January transfers</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite the comments just weeks ago suggesting he would have identified several goals for January transfers, the NSW Rangers boss, Mark Warburton is wary when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn't want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.</seg>
<seg id="28">The former head of Brentford said: "The period of January transfers is very different from that of summer."</seg>
<seg id="29">In the case of players transferred the summer, there are the pre-season in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.</seg>
<seg id="30">The team is doing very well.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players who aren't needed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Celtic target Michu after retirement</seg>
<seg id="33">Swansea's Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could retire at the end of the contract with Swans.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 29-year-old player struggled two years with problems at ankle and failed to leave Wales in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hearts clash with SFA on Neilson's comments</seg>
<seg id="36">Hearts were running 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost 3-2, but the FCC's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "We haven't questioned integrity, we haven't commented on Spotify."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths jacks to avoid Tyneastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The hipster Hipbee was taken to the point after admitting he sang a song with defamatory lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skthat.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in Edinburgh's Rinchurn region ahead of a Derby with Edinburgh at Tyneastle.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was Derby and it was the excitement of the moment," Trump said, adding: "I don't need to say I'm not going back to Tyneastle than if I play for Celtic."</seg>
<seg id="42">Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly</seg>
<seg id="43">Simon Donnelly insists that those on the Dundee United board still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.</seg>
<seg id="45">II will once again bring boys in shape, "Donnelly said.</seg>
<seg id="46">McInnes is happy for "dirty win" against Hamilton</seg>
<seg id="47">Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must cling to Hamilton Acters desperately to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points to Celtic thanks to the first half-half penalty carried out by Adam Rooney.</seg>
<seg id="48">McInnes said: "There is no team that would have won something, in the cup or league, and that won't have won games like that."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will look like a man to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the execution room of the Oklahoma State prison, and I'll see how Richard Giffe is executed by administering lethal injections.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation came first in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day is approaching, I am appalled by the idea.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ASA, why do I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">True, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the demands exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">The elected ones will look at the execution with impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I would stand next to Richard Giffe's closest friends, in addition I have developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two-and-a-half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the type.</seg>
<seg id="16">Radem often a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prison authorities say they can't be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not going to allow me to have a carnett and a pix to score what they see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'll have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist in Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">He tells the story of the detainee as he wants it, getting access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I cried at her.</seg>
<seg id="23">He admitted he "could have done better," but he still believes they are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Giffe disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote to them.</seg>
<seg id="25">I don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants to be present an international report to write about the subject.</seg>
<seg id="28">It believes that if he dies, the advert will help the movement against capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Belller, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I will not come back here on all of the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't say with certainty that Richard Giffe is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese are guilty of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="36">I think his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And I'll look at him dying from that perspective.</seg>
<seg id="38">I can't pretend I'm totally objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.</seg>
<seg id="40">From me you'll find out how it's to watch a man I like dying needlessly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claims Queensland tried to spy on and threaten to pull out of races</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody said Queensland Racing Victoria had tried to infiltrate a spy at its gallons last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.</seg>
<seg id="3">It launched an attack against Queensland and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him, the straw that filled the glass as the removal of Lady Tatai in the race because of a treatment administered on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he has always tried to do what is best for the field of races and that he's put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to the test for Lidari's bowler, for which he has no explanation.</seg>
<seg id="5">For 18 months she swallowed his words about statements about spies and didn't want to resemble "foxes that don't get to grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything bursts out suddenly," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is known to have continued.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and we must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Disney will go home and I'll sleep quietly.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to go head-to-head and I want the owners with whom I am working to see that I strive to give them everything that is better.</seg>
<seg id="11">From the time they start to think it doesn't happen, I have to give up the workout profession.</seg>
<seg id="12">At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on graphies.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dillon Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room alongside a man - whose name I will tell him if I am asked - and offered to hire him to my graphies to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">Obviously I consider myself a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="16">If so, then they should give all their resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should I think it's something personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Is it necessary for the RVL to start having the backbone and can fire outsiders for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Do I have a bad influence on the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">So bad is my influence on the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe that's how the others see.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe I have to take my licence and give me a part, and I don't have doubts that the statements they are doing now might prompt them to think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, I have reached the point where I do not care and that is what I am saddened.</seg>
<seg id="25">I am very saddened.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'm going to put pressure on and get him to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">My family supports me and I can leave.</seg>
<seg id="28">The youngster's frustration grew with the long-running probe into testing at the other in which Lidari was involved and the removal prompted him to say he could "get his licence on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, whose name is most commonly associated with beating the undefeated Black Caviar, labelled the treatment rule on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after applying on the feet of horses a pupil with namesy or argas, which violates the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">That concludes the rules of the races.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take my full responsibility for that, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my employees put them out of the red sludge on the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have happened last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have happened yesterday, which happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">It happened on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting of the application of the puppies, for which Queensland has opened an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who make these rules know nothing about horses.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to their opponents in doping charges.</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the placenta used by his team as "distorted topics" brought into question by the NRL's top two favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed players from the Storm to "take them to the throne" team in the game's nervous game in Sydney's qualifying final on Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game a "show" of rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland were not too much in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy jumped in the defence of the touchy touchdown approached by his team and said the players were simply on "touch" when the plates were.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches slammed her team, meaning they were Incare that the Storm would beat them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And things don't stop there - I didn't hear Trent Robinson to complain about the ball when they beat us with the score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in the plates, and so we have changed the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a lovely team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a fox for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nosus how it's always going on during this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "Anima Football," recalling his mentors St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about thrilling football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He argued his mind comparing his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday evening and talked about how thrilling the game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010 St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he was not interested in either as black under the angle.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play what we see as thrilling football, especially thanks to fast-paced young midfielders.</seg>
<seg id="16">The sort of game you want to do when you have such players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He brought that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not any team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play.</seg>
<seg id="18">It gives me more confidence because they say these things because I am somewhat impervious to the match with us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they were probably not thinking about us when they were thinking about key matches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the match between the Storm and the Roosters has been a more fierce competition over the score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos match was probably a good match, we didn't see him yet, how long was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game finished 20-18, in our game there were two tries, that's the thrilling game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or thrilling, do you mean making breaks and not kidding?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me they are plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">If I talk about us, it means that at one point we could meet them.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in Saturday's final qualifying final at AAMI Park, with tickets putting on sale starting next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used the smartphone to lure paedophiles to send pictures</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was then sleeping in an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images having children as a subject.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl later woke up and noticed the phone's disappearance, which he found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.</seg>
<seg id="5">She looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the arrival, police saw the five pictures then looked at computers found at the scene and found "disturbing" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of all children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg pretended to have done it to "attract paedophile" on the Internet before "claiming to be a policeman to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: "He said he was an addiction - that he's addicted to scared people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted he had made searches on the computer but said he did because he wanted to turn himself as a policeman to scare the paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked the person to stop sending them and other pictures.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said she did it to lure.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he is no longer thinking clearly when she is drinking and wants to see images of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Robertson added: 'When the girl found the messages on the phone, she shouted her mother and screaming and crying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shirta saw indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Shirta was photographed and told the defendant used the computer and the designer to speak to girls who seemed much younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23, enrolled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had carried out or made indecent pictures of all children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at his appearance on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence counsel Gregor SIM has called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offenders' register because it can be said that the offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."</seg>
<seg id="18">Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was released on bail in the file but remained in custody before the ordeal for other files.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was passed on the sex offenders' register before he was given the sentence.</seg>

<seg id="5">"These restructuring will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise to a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs," said Meg Whitman, president and director general HP, who will lead the unit after the split.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad business portfolio that will help transition firms to the new style of business," Whitman said.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our worldwide customers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Under a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "focus on providing integrated without rival solutions" to companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is said to be an object of the work of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called "the cradle of Silicon Valley."</seg>

<seg id="11">The move taken HP, the world's second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, relying on the idea that businesses focusing their attention better in a direction have a better performance.</seg>

<seg id="1">KingsFest: Comedy series that taught us important lessons about the friendship between men</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar personation in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death to men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more frequent in men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to deal with the problem, the Campaign Against Mental Life (Lib Dems) named 2015 as the Year of Barrier, keen to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to achieve this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students showing depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood," her chances of recovery are doubling down.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the same extent, for people who aren't depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorder appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of course, for the friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this era of communication dominated by social media, where the focus is on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with meaning.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital trajectories have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, open-minded figure to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This shallow success is dominated by what psychologists call extrexi values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even more deeply.</seg>
<seg id="12">The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of the Friends series was that he turned attention to this idea.</seg>
<seg id="14">The characters were not defined by the job but of their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The frequent booze of Joey and Chandler, the moments in which he looks at football in the first comet and Ross's passion for Rachel came out of the fact that it is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even if they often complain to completely explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a social worker explained to me: "... my role to listen to people with the tendency of suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to speak with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage to do it is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to give more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="20">The show highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.</seg>
<seg id="21">Oed by much helps objective intervention, outside, through the phone, people have in times of desperation, long-term support comes from family and close friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, if you attend this weekend at a SFest organised by Central Avenue, with complete restoration of the shoot-to-shoot plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is never known what difference your friendship could do.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends is broadcast by Central Aberdeen at the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of the SnowsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria Marks and helps PSG set aside</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria marked his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG impose himself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="4">We continue to present the pain of the match and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the match series in the Champions League series, with an emphatic 2-0 win against Malmo in the game on Tuesday on Parc des Prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria marked in less than four minutes after the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the champions France into the lead although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the Cavani goal in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not only qualification in the bullpen but also an improvement of the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the chance of goal after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club he began his brilliant career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win creates trouble for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference to the next scorer, even though there are issues you have to refine along the season," Blanc says.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and I did it, although I am sorry we weren't able to give one or two goals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the Paris squad, with a 2-2 replay at home by Bordeaux in League 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who would lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed that when he tasered to Marco Verratti's care behind the defence of Malmo before getting incredible over Johan Wiland in the long corner of the right goal.</seg>
<seg id="14">But if anyone expected PSG to get the win over their fingers, they were disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine runs to national teams, with a defence of five people and two defensively defensive midfielders, was a strong contender.</seg>
<seg id="16">But their attack was not impressive, with the exception doing by Nikola Djurdjic who crossed Kevin Trump's post in the 34th minute.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and uncompleting the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tries only in the first half and was then replaced by the Cavani even after the game resumed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilful in supporting his colleagues, who he cares about as the one that Di Maria sent in a deviant nose by Wilmingfish in the 52nd minute.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal was scored in a final after an hour in the match, thanks to Cavani, uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic cared for Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That goal removed the hope from Malmo that they would re-balance the score and only a superb shot of Wilmington from the distance to reject David Luiz kept the final score before the newly intruder Ezequiel Lavezzi overturned a goal in stoppage time.</seg>
<seg id="21">The team's Norwegian coach in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said PSG were with a class above and that "the last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which is not up to the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The caliphate is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Jos hats off for PSG.</seg>
<seg id="25">They've done an excellent game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xi calls for broader global economy expansion</seg>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy needs to open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improve opening policies," Xi said, as part of the 16th meeting of the Central NSW Committee for Continuing General Reforms (Central Leishman Group for Deepening Overall.).</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will take place for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leadership group has adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private equity and reorganisation of the residents' registration system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investment is not allowed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, providing a business environment based on legislation and providing greater openness to the market.</seg>
<seg id="9">State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a bid to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The state authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and protect the legitimate interests of companies established out of foreign investment and provide them with better services," according to the statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called 'green cards', optimising the requirements and simplifying the process of submitting applications.</seg>
<seg id="14">The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2">Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of education unions have not reached any result, with the government proposing a 10% wage hike since 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and trade unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or one of 20%, since December.</seg>
<seg id="3">The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the prime minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cincanu, Finance Minister Eugen Gravovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today's Government proposal did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have reached the situation by convening the leaderships of our federations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 10 percent that have been promised today are for us less than what we expect.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ponta: In future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held to attend and representatives of the government to present the country's confederation representatives in the country proposal for wage growth, with trade unionists deciding whether to accept the executive's offer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The prime minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Law on Employment as quickly as possible to Parliament so that it can enter into force on 1 December.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the piece of legislation, salaries in the education system are expected by 25 per cent of the total 70 per cent increase, an increase in the document to be made in the next four years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor Ponta also promised them trade unionists in the entirety of the 2016 court rulings.</seg>

<seg id="1">The government approved, on Wednesday, the "national immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan on the Year," documents deemed to be "still a stage Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory," according to a press release.</seg>
<seg id="2">The source quoted as saying that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directions that reflect the policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.</seg>
<seg id="3">In view of the problems faced by the countries of the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures are being considered for the uniform and coherent management of situations stemming from the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania's territory, resulting from crises of political, social, economic or military nature.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens coming from countries with potential migration or which can achieve national safety," the source added.</seg>
<seg id="5">The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the outlying areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, the document also sets several general strategic objectives relating to immigration, such as: Promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on Romania's territory and the proper application of measures to move away and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.</seg>
<seg id="7">The national strategy also includes relevant specific objectives for the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.</seg>
<seg id="8">These include: Facilitating access to Romanian territory of third-party nationals who respond to employment needs, favouring the access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as flawed.</seg>
<seg id="9">With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is' a means by which concrete activities are set to lead to the creation of a flexible system for halting the growing migrant phenomenon '.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parliament's culture committees rejected a report by the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014 on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">For rejecting the report, 17 MPs voted, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices together.</seg>
<seg id="5">They will decide, probably next week.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the next plenary sitting, it will be debated.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I think that given this situation will be made relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Commission Chairman Georgica Severin.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership would be present at this meeting, while at the meeting of the Culture Committees, no representative of the TVR leadership was present.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was common sense to be the presence of TVR, because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.</seg>
<seg id="10">The invitation has been made to members of the CA since last night, with a approximate hour that we knew no new hour, but today, after the Happy Birth sitting, I personally sent a fax to the Swiss leadership inviting it.</seg>
<seg id="11">I believe that when Esti summoned, you have been a budget worker, paid out of public taxes and Esti summoned to a committee meeting, even if you do not like living.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Because it is your duty of service, Esti in an institution in charge of Parliament," Severin said after the session of Parliament's joint committee of culture.</seg>
<seg id="13">He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id="14">The debt we saw and as they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been on the day, but they didn't pay from the historical ones.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I remind you that not from my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that leisure with the banks and the taxman, they are clear management issues," Severin said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He added that after the work report was rejected by the plenary session, elections will follow for a new board of directors, and he will elect the director general of the institution.</seg>
<seg id="17">I do not know who will be proposed for this position.</seg>
<seg id="18">Miracles will not be done.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is important to make political decisions so that this institution works.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not the man to lie, let's tell you it's going to come up with a genius that's going to sit in the queue here and it's going to beat.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that those who decide, Parliament's plenary, have their vote to choose with a great deal of sense on the people who will lead the Vlachs.</seg>
<seg id="22">It needs to be people who know what's going on there, having experience and having a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.</seg>
<seg id="23">I do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they have to have - good sense in attitude towards employees because it is a malware that comes from employees, complaints, redundancies.</seg>
<seg id="24">"When you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although he did not appear in Parliament, the president-general of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which it calls for Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV tax.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the letter, Stelian Tanase asks, in addition to indexing the TV tax, modifying and complementing 978 / 2003 on the tax on public television service, in the sense of updating the provisions on the level of technology changes to the day, as well as for regulating the procedure for control in the area of payment of the TV tax and the finding of penalties and the application of penalties and penalties.</seg>
<seg id="27">He also wants a provision to be issued to provide for an extension of the requirement for all electricity providers to become SRTs to collect the TV tax, through the involvement of ANRE in regulating this activity.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his opinion, there is a need to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the VAT.</seg>
<seg id="29">Stelian Tanase is calling for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public broadcaster and the contribution for CNC from 15 per cent to the 3 per cent level, but also changes to the 41 / 1994 law, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget / funding allowances for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - the World Football Championship, Golden Connecticut, Eurovision.</seg>
<seg id="30">He maintains that SRTv will default in the coming months as Labour legislation obliges the employer to implement court rulings, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are facing priority over any other obligation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending with TV staff and production.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So the trips and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July, ABC News has been closed," the letter of the Austrian president said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Without the support of the state institutions - the government, Parliament, the presidency - Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission," the letter reads.</seg>
<seg id="35">The head of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.</seg>

<seg id="8">"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Romanian prime minister added that he is advocating rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, noting that the brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and safety brutality will not solve the problem - it will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries in which the refugees are fleeing!</seg>
<seg id="11">"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is totally contrary to these goals and values!" The head of the Romanian executive stressed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto qualified as "mere lies" with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, noting that the claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and misleading remarks" in Romania's domestic political crisis, and made it clear that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.</seg>
<seg id="14">Szijjarto referred to a statement by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="15">What I have said and always say is that I am against the xenophobic speeches that we close borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages, and I am totally opposed to this approach.</seg>
<seg id="16">If we can get more, we will get it, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbours, with Bata and the insert.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With that I disagree," the head of the Romanian executive said in a press conference in BuzzJiu.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government has decided to begin preparations in the field for expanding the border with Romania of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to lift a fence at borders does not solve anything from the refugee issue and "get Hungary out of Europe."</seg>

<seg id="2">Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partly responsible" by the collapse of a cranes on Friday in the Great Mosque in Mecca, a crash that 107 people died.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an investigative commission, the company did not "comply with safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company's directors have been given a ban to leave the country until the investigation is completed in this case.</seg>
<seg id="5">The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="6">The construction firm is owned by the family of former Al-Qaida terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.</seg>
<seg id="8">Binoo Group is working for 4 years at the Big Moskeys expansion to be able to host more pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="9">The crash happened on Friday evening during a storm when a machete, probably lopsided by strong winds of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the Black Moskeys' roof at Mecca.</seg>
<seg id="10">Following the crash, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to shut them off the mouth of the challenge</seg>
<seg id="2">Considered by many world the biggest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labelled, after retiring from the work, as a poor coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new position as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">After unhappy experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the coaching role at the Future of Constanta, the team they are sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a year after the team took over, King showed he was capable of turning a team that was lying to save from relegation in one of the top.</seg>
<seg id="5">So after a year of days, the Future recorded, with Hagger, 16 wins, 11 rebounds and 11 defeats.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Billionaire is one of a top team, which is knocking on European cups.</seg>
<seg id="7">Things took an even better turn for the Future this season as the team reached second place in the League 1 with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.</seg>
<seg id="8">The future also has the best attacking in League 1, with 20 goals (par with Glass), more than double than the Star.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, even though he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start-up team there were names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.</seg>
<seg id="10">The club's policy has made the Future a team of watch for teams abroad, so Hagi has sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexander Mitrita (Bari - 500 euros).</seg>
<seg id="11">Alongside Star Wars, the Future is the only profitable team in the Premier League, according to data from the Trade Registry.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.</seg>
<seg id="3">Large countries are coming up with solutions for the whole of the EU, says Cristian Ghea, a member of the college director of the Romanian Centre for European Policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghoud showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from."</seg>
<seg id="5">But they are the masses who have embarked on and we cannot return history.</seg>
<seg id="6">Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well as possible and to adapt them to us.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Cristian Ghea's view, we are at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.</seg>
<seg id="8">After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: 'Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which has not been adapted for the situation of now'.</seg>
<seg id="9">Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council which, in fact, has not solved anything?</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the board.</seg>
<seg id="11">All the pronouns were saying they would have had the necessary votes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before the Treaty of Lisbon, in JHA, the principle of unanimity applies and any state could block any decision.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the board approves with the vote of 55% of states, namely 16, which account for 65% of the EU's population.</seg>
<seg id="15">The calculations were saying the votes were there.</seg>
<seg id="16">But they didn't want to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because it is a sensitive issue, there has been a rejection reaction even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear that an EU-type reaction sends us migrants to the head. "</seg>
<seg id="18">They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the governance of Schengen and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.</seg>
<seg id="19">So mandatory quotas were not really discarded, but the subject was just left to cooling?</seg>
<seg id="20">Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Greece's border with Turkey is also the German border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits to the old Schengen system.</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps the Dublin principle will be dropped, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which it is the first time, because it is unsustainable.</seg>
<seg id="23">If Greece is potting, you cannot simply say that it is Greece's job.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is common.</seg>
<seg id="25">Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve it without a precise, perhaps binding, mechanism for sharing the effort of the reception?</seg>
<seg id="26">No one knows exactly how compulsory quotas will work, if they get to them.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because it remains a problem: What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?</seg>
<seg id="28">I do not believe that the European states will be able to take the migrants on top of the migrants: You go to the country of X or in the country of Y.</seg>
<seg id="29">There will probably be some single filtering centres, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is working on solutions like this.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the problem does not have a simple solution.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase their hatred.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just started to go to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="34">One estimate says that only 10 per cent were going to leave, winter is hard for the Mediterranean, but we expect the next year at a potentially even bigger wave.</seg>
<seg id="35">What do we do with people?</seg>
<seg id="36">My mum is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look so catastrophic from a media point of view.</seg>
<seg id="37">Swung by countries with lower or higher experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">Does it seem to me that there is any place where the integration of large groups from a supra-European culture really succeeded?</seg>
<seg id="39">I look at the magreaves in France, to Turks in Germany, they are all in-depth.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would not go towards radical statements.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sure, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.</seg>
<seg id="42">It remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="43">But pure means will not work.</seg>
<seg id="44">Let us create the fortress Europe is illusory.</seg>
<seg id="45">We must humiliate the integration mechanisms in European societies.</seg>
<seg id="46">Here were some mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="47">We need to be more pretentious.</seg>
<seg id="48">Let them ask these people to learn the language, try to take up the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of the family, including through marriages of convenience.</seg>
<seg id="49">However, the imminent problem of these people with the long-term problem of their integration must be separated.</seg>
<seg id="50">If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we must look at them how they are drowning in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="51">Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from.</seg>
<seg id="52">And if it's going to be an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to recover the country overnight and you can take it back.</seg>
<seg id="53">Until we defend solutions, we see the fortress within Europe.</seg>
<seg id="54">Borders have been closed, walls are being erected, border controls are being re-introduced in the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="55">Is the European project at risk?</seg>
<seg id="56">The European project as such is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so the pressure was too high on the countries where they put these migrants on foot for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="58">That is, we are moving freely by Colo, but every e with her problems.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the face of such a wave, this is not the case, because some countries are not coping.</seg>
<seg id="60">When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they do something, but in the long term it doesn't change much.</seg>
<seg id="61">After the bombings in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.</seg>
<seg id="62">It is a wave of public emotion that is being installed in both senses.</seg>
<seg id="63">And it's so unstable from one week to the other that you can't make decisions based on them.</seg>
<seg id="64">We have a lot of talk, many bellicous statements from politicians at home under the pressure to be viruses.</seg>
<seg id="65">And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion is moving.</seg>
<seg id="66">After the public emotion goes through, we will return to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.</seg>
<seg id="67">This is the single European single market.</seg>
<seg id="68">And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of free movement.</seg>
<seg id="69">That will be other rules.</seg>
<seg id="70">Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which has not been adapted for the situation now.</seg>
<seg id="71">Is Romania how it has played so far in this crisis?</seg>
<seg id="72">Like a small country, which believes that if it shoots as an eye and astings their ears, the theme disappears.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the face of the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say that it is not your small country.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.</seg>
<seg id="75">Don't Eknow, you don't play at home level.</seg>
<seg id="76">Large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the EU, good or bad, and we are not talking about their quality now.</seg>
<seg id="77">The SAA as Poland has done.</seg>
<seg id="78">On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of Romanians for Schengen will decrease greatly.</seg>
<seg id="79">President Joseph Hannis says it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.</seg>
<seg id="80">So we move from the desperation to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.</seg>
<seg id="81">There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen for migrants to see us as an alternative route.</seg>
<seg id="82">That does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.</seg>
<seg id="83">Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but made in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries deemed safe.</seg>
<seg id="84">The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.</seg>
<seg id="85">Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?</seg>
<seg id="86">Russia has a frustrated power of power.</seg>
<seg id="87">She believes that being a great power means to confront Americans and Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="88">From that point of view, yes, there is a connection.</seg>
<seg id="89">Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.</seg>
<seg id="90">And it was good to crash before his main opponent was the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="91">Any two years have been a fight between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by Gulf and Western countries.</seg>
<seg id="92">Then there was the Islamic State, and now we don't know if the Assad regime wants to fall.</seg>
<seg id="93">Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.</seg>
<seg id="94">It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.</seg>
<seg id="95">But Esti great power only if you have solutions.</seg>
<seg id="96">The off-Side game is just a strategy to win time.</seg>
<seg id="97">Putin is likely to be offered offers, apps him on the buttons to fix the situation.</seg>
<seg id="98">The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can somehow solve the issues created by him.</seg>
<seg id="99">But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are mannered by an invisible hand.</seg>
<seg id="100">Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.</seg>

<seg id="1">What a button to appear soon</seg>
<seg id="2">Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Yes" button, and now representatives of the social networking network are preparing another opposite, the "Disney."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that the button will soon be available, the New York Times reports on the blog.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zuckerberg made it clear that the "Disney" button would rather show a nude of what a user feels than a simple option.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zuckerberg noted he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account an important life event, and someone else will give "Disney."</seg>
<seg id="7">Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mark Zuckerberg has also said he is not very comfortable for people to give "time" to current events such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You may not feel comfortable to give the weight of that posting," the Facebook representative noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">The variant of a new Facebook button has not been welcomed by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="11">"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social networking sites," commented Atkins Haneef of Afghanistan on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I'm going to give 'Disney' the 'Disney' butt," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, argued there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="14">Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer company, noted it was hard to imagine a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, she claims, the campaign trail is approaching in America, and the "Disney" button would create a total disaster.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands coming to the border at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyia Bakondi announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.</seg>
<seg id="4">The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just yesterday they said they would logo the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to seek asylum.</seg>
<seg id="6">"As you see, this is totally different," Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two builders, in insolvency</seg>
<seg id="3">The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, sit down because they have been stopped several times.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during work.</seg>
<seg id="5">The headquarters of the County Council in the Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up alone.</seg>
<seg id="6">A year and a half since the building work and the remanded of the building should have been completed, the work has not reached half.</seg>
<seg id="7">A last stage in the cycle of the building was consumed last days when the National Security Council Resolution Board (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the firm who wished to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for the work that is still to be executed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The original project was drawn up by Impex Rompupel SA.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the builder's insolvency and the interruption of work, the negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of a participation announcement with Impex Rompupel, with the firm expected to update the technical project and then be held a new tender for the works.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The negotiations, however, were not completed by a contract, CJ lauding that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage," said Razvan Carthal, who represented public relations within the CJ.</seg>
<seg id="11">CJ's decision to break direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Rompupel.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Victorian court has sent the complaint to the CNSC, which has rejected it, as a belated one.</seg>
<seg id="13">That doesn't mean, however, that CJ can start searching for another projector.</seg>
<seg id="14">Impex Rompupel has the possibility of attacking the CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, barely after a final sentence of it to consider finding another projector.</seg>
<seg id="15">So work to strengthen the building could resume at least next year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">In principle, the recovery of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach a contract.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC's decision will be attacked or not," Mr Nagy said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Work to strengthen the former headquarters of Chestura Pollard began in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="20">A first trailer was canceled in April 2012 after carrying out $4.5 million in works.</seg>
<seg id="21">The tender was resumed, with the contract being secured by Moldoo SA.</seg>
<seg id="22">The firm, however, entered the insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.</seg>
<seg id="23">The work has so far been achieved by around 50%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Initially, the building work, reauthorization and the building of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adventures in the Stone Age</seg>
<seg id="2">In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major ballistic handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's handball team for qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.</seg>
<seg id="3">Romanian Handball Federation President Alexander Dedu said yesterday during a meeting with the media that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.</seg>
<seg id="4">As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is qualification at the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of bowlers and dine, primarily the World Championship and second, the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.</seg>
<seg id="5">We want very hard to qualify for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are fantastic requirements from the technical bullet led by Tomas Ryde.</seg>
<seg id="7">Staf who will be composed of seven or eight people.</seg>
<seg id="8">He wants the back coach, a doctor, two mascara, coach of Portsmouth, the physical processor, head of delegation.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have asked us to achieve the qualifications of some things, precisely materials for physical preparation, which I have never heard.</seg>
<seg id="10">I do all to get to the Olympian Games, and I'll do everything I do to have them.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are talking about a massive investment, there are many, many money.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that's the way to do the performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because at the moment we're in the Stone Age with preparation.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The teams with which we don't deal with these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that he was trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and VR.</seg>
<seg id="15">The president of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.</seg>
<seg id="16">We do not have the Chamber in Bucharest.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is a problem of infrastructure, and it is disgraceful that a European gymnastics Championship is called into question.</seg>
<seg id="18">Let us not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighbourhoods have been built entirely in a two-year period.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona, it was a rubbish dump, and now it has reached a landmark of Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was the same in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investment as well.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.</seg>
<seg id="22">He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Gatu has been in a civilised way with a project, people gave their consent in principle but quickly made it clear that he would never build the room.</seg>

<seg id="1">Good road to the World Cup</seg>
<seg id="2">Romanian jihadists start on September 23rd, against France</seg>
<seg id="3">National rugby team captain Mihai Macovei said in a press conference Tuesday that all of Romania's players are ready for World Cup matches in England, where they hope to get two wins: "We are ready."</seg>
<seg id="4">Both I and my colleagues are with the engines of maximum turtle.</seg>
<seg id="5">We trained to give the best yield in the four games.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="7">All groups are heavy and ours is the same.</seg>
<seg id="8">Take it easy, the first time with France and then we'll see.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.</seg>
<seg id="10">I cannot, in words, describe the joy of participation in the World Cup, which has so many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="11">I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the Rugby family and come up with beautiful results at home.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We want to be proud that some players, a small family like Rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolour," Macovei said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Romanian national team manager Lynn Champion, who was at the first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of selected rugby: "It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="15">For me it's an extraordinary experience.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is very important for me that every game makes Romanians proud of the national team.</seg>
<seg id="17">The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Kas, has confidence that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.</seg>
<seg id="19">I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the end of the event.</seg>
<seg id="20">"These boys have started playing in Romania's teams on 18-19 years, so there is cohesion, it's a gang of friends, who have set their way to achieve a dream," Tas said.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following games scheduled: With France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada, on October 6th in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October at Exeter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The competition begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London, with England's match - Fiji in the group A.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patania a tourist</seg>
<seg id="3">A tourist family in Cluj came to Iowa to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the experience, neither my wife wants to cook in your town anymore.</seg>
<seg id="5">Without wanting, they have been hit by mischievous information, unsensing controller of the RAPT and, bonus, of a fine "as the so-called law."</seg>
<seg id="6">The Suns arrived in Ibiza a few days ago, crammed into a Centre hotel and called for touristers.</seg>
<seg id="7">They also got a touchdown in which RATP trails were crossed.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Armed" with these maps, the wives visited the Isis.</seg>
<seg id="9">But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because it was not tongues with tickets to the station near Copou Park, they relied on printed information on the catcher: That they can take a ticket through SMS.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has not told anyone that this service is no longer there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Confident in the catcher, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after instructions on the catcher.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately for them, there has been a team of controllers RATP.</seg>
<seg id="14">They said there was no more than 2-year-old service and that it was announced in the media that it was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know where SA know what has been written in local media, I coming up with an evening before I visit the city?</seg>
<seg id="16">I spoke to the controllers, explained their situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.</seg>
<seg id="17">The attitude was very defiant.</seg>
<seg id="18">They said all I can do is give us a single fine instead of 2 (ml and wife).</seg>
<seg id="19">"I paid, I didn't want to spoil my day visiting the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Said Ovidiu.</seg>
<seg id="20">In conclusion, the family was fined due to erroneous information on horseback and controllers who "applied the law to blood."</seg>
<seg id="21">It's not fair, and I've made a reference to RATP Ibiza to recover my money.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not money, I am not overly happy, but the idea is that I felt cheated.</seg>

<seg id="1">I am unlucky for the rapists in the Vaslui.</seg>
<seg id="2">They had the accident and remained in cardiac arrest</seg>
<seg id="3">The trial of seven rapists from the Cowboys moved, yesterday, to the Ibiza Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Parramatta have tried the first trial term in an undisclosed session in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old woman have asked to be put at large.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prior to the actual start of the courtroom, one of the extraordinary judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, formulated a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The magistrate has been sworn in this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the chairman of the Pistorius section, he was the one who, on 9 April, admitted a dispute made by four of the defendants, with their placement under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, the file is judged by a full of which includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Raymond.</seg>
<seg id="8">Previously, in the file she formulated a abstention and judge Dan Birton on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship of competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two judges decided that rapists from the Cowboys continue to remain in cardiac arrest.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ti Cubs will remain jailed for at least another 30 days, when Jude Yorkers will re-discuss the possibility of putting them at large.</seg>
<seg id="11">The trial deadline will be held at the Ibiza Court of Appeals on 6 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before reaching the Ibiza Court of Appeal, the duba with which the rapists were transported from the Cowboys was involved in a crash in the Packers neighborhood, the car entering ISIS on the belt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Autoslitara Iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks Commodore car floating on the street and the driver tried to cook on the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Duba is moving from the end of the Packers.</seg>
<seg id="15">The car went into Ibiza on the ground because the Penrith Fire Administration employees preferred the route from the Cowboys to Ibiza on graphene, then on the belt.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have thus cut the road a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="17">Immediately after the impact, escort arrested another shipment to take over the inmates.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shortly, at the scene of the crash, a car was sent from Pennington High Safety Station, which took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the aftermath of the crash, none of the detainees were injured.</seg>
<seg id="20">To transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the rear side of the Masi Sharks, and the detains took off the speed, two by two.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The incident has not been reported to Pollard because the drivers of the UA motor vehicles have understood amiable in terms of the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu, of the IPJ.</seg>

<seg id="1">Big migrations</seg>
<seg id="2">Romania is neither nor will it be ready for what to follow.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Europe?</seg>
<seg id="4">I say it from the outset, clear and clear: The 20 000 refugees they should and must naturalise Romania is, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.</seg>
<seg id="5">For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to around 1 500 discards, is far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="6">Surely, if those migrants even accept to settle in our cities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.</seg>
<seg id="8">Parazed by mobsters and paralysed by a venomous political class, the Romanian state is proving bogged down in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="9">Being able to integrate Gypsies is just a banal example.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to that, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent medical care, raise the mess on the street, create paid jobs or keep their young generation home.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why would refugees settle into another country in which it is running away?</seg>
<seg id="12">But what makes a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being treated.</seg>
<seg id="13">We are first hit by the bellicia of the EU's strong states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the problems with smaller countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then comes the friction of Romanians who, although they have millions of people scattered everywhere in the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is probably afraid not to steal his carpets.</seg>
<seg id="16">After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they cite only the horrors of war as a reason for the departure, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.</seg>
<seg id="18">Likewise, the simplistic way in which the crisis is considered can only be mocked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The causes must be removed, I support some and, by strictly speaking on the card of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in Romania, there is peace, and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Why do they leave?</seg>
<seg id="22">In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed to us as an anatomy, divisive and outdated construction.</seg>
<seg id="23">I am complaining that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but the fact that neither the EU has any plans for the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">And improvisation and threats don't help anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">Then, what more is the EU using, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be put into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders as a cheese?</seg>
<seg id="26">At some point, the war in Syria will end.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not the migrant crisis, however.</seg>
<seg id="28">Over the coming decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, depletion of resources etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.</seg>
<seg id="29">With such politicians, Romania is neither nor will it ever be ready for what to follow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive: A meeting that Iti breaks the heart.</seg>
<seg id="2">At 20 he was given a brave gift: Biological parents</seg>
<seg id="3">Lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the non-hatred of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, little, bolted and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years where adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited with the biological parents in a county village, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything of others.</seg>
<seg id="4">Crina will be in her 20s, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give their loved daughter a stunning and brave gift: A visit to Romania in Iowa to know her unclear past.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Ibiza newspaper," which assisted the family's search efforts after several highly vague hints, witnessed these meetings that virtually Iti rup the heart.</seg>
<seg id="6">The coverage of reporters, the emotions of the bait, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright slow and awesome.</seg>
<seg id="7">The story of the Crash begins 20 years ago in the Victorian town of Prayer, which he was only two months old.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be internalized in hospital, to the city.</seg>
<seg id="9">At home, there began to be misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to parish her home.</seg>
<seg id="10">He decided to keep the girl, and on me to send me from home.</seg>
<seg id="11">He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.</seg>
<seg id="12">"When I learned that he was in hospital, it was too late," recalls Rob Alina, the mother's biological mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crina was internalized with her grandmother at the city hospital in Paskeys, and also then the girl's father, Cosby Balcan, left work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their buckets had to break up definitively.</seg>
<seg id="15">They haven't found Crina at the hospital</seg>
<seg id="16">After the internment, the father of Crash had gone to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the Iowa hospital and the father, when he returned, did not find it.</seg>
<seg id="18">I think he had been waiting nearly nine months since the girl was in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I would have thought it was abandoned," says one granddaughter of the family.</seg>
<seg id="20">Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Crina in Iowa, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child during this time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and the Protection of Isis Child, which then gave her to care for the Sleeper Center in Bucium.</seg>
<seg id="22">They were years when leaving and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the Bucium Center was found by the Lib Dems and his wife, a couple in Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="24">They fell in love with Blonde Crina, and after some time she had to move permanently with them to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="25">The little has already been spent almost two years, how long the adoption formalities took place.</seg>
<seg id="26">When I saw Crina, I felt like it was our face.</seg>
<seg id="27">"As if my wife would have given her life," says Smiler, the adoptive father, as he catches in the palm of his hand-shaking hand.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Cosby, continued their search separately, each on where she was able to.</seg>
<seg id="29">The father asked the authorities in Prayer but did not receive any answers where his child could be.</seg>
<seg id="30">Police then told him that it was possible to be bullied, but in Iowa parents learned what really happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="31">When I looked at it here, they told me at the Court that it was gone to Italy, in Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="32">And the conditions to look for I didn't have.</seg>
<seg id="33">We asked God to be fine.</seg>
<seg id="34">I thought about her in all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities for umblam, to find it.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crash's biological mother.</seg>
<seg id="36">But even if the years passed, the parents of Rugby were not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Italy, Commodore and wife explained to her face where it comes and that her past links it to Romania.</seg>
<seg id="38">I was small when I learned.</seg>
<seg id="39">I think we had five or six years.</seg>
<seg id="40">I reacted like a cops, I was curious.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," says delighted Crina.</seg>
<seg id="42">And her dream was going to become reality.</seg>
<seg id="43">In March this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner, director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention, Review and Antibiotic Adventure, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, which explained the Lib Dems' desire to find the biological family of Crash.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the search just started from a name.</seg>
<seg id="45">After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.</seg>
<seg id="46">Primisem only a name, Balcan Costica, then the locality, Prayer.</seg>
<seg id="47">Soon we had a work with the City Hall there, and I was able to ask if there was by all the names received.</seg>
<seg id="48">Then they gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the most desirable.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It took until nearly a month of days until we find the biological father of the face," explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner.</seg>
<seg id="50">In all, more than three months have taken authorities to find Cosby and Alina, especially that they are residing in another locality.</seg>
<seg id="51">We started the move somewhere in March, and in the months of June and July, we completed the identification of biological monks and discussions.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Then we determined that a first meeting was held in September," added Romica Ierner.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the weekend that passed, Alina and Cosby saw her first face lost on the hallway of the Iowa hospital 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="54">The father, excited, was barely able to contain his tears, and the hands of the treadmill continued.</seg>
<seg id="55">It's just changing a few words with the surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="56">A week before the meeting, they were not even able to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="57">He was all excited, I hate.</seg>
<seg id="58">"To be able to see the child after so many years, it's something," she tells us a granddaughter, cast and she with Cosby's Prayer.</seg>
<seg id="59">Meeting the Crash with mother and biological brother</seg>
<seg id="60">In talks with the girl, who is expected to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Cosby Balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him, in the village, to come quiet: II can give something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and claw a household.</seg>
<seg id="61">Her mother and she moved, she cries, and she thinks it's hard that something like that can happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="62">I'm very embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="63">I didn't think it could happen like that.</seg>
<seg id="64">I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be so.</seg>
<seg id="65">They are very big emotions.</seg>
<seg id="66">If he could forgive me.</seg>
<seg id="67">I hope that we will visit us in the future.</seg>
<seg id="68">"I hope that we can keep a connection," he tells us with great tears on the obitui Alina, the mother of the Crash, while holding a hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="69">He also hides his tears, thankfully, because soon he will see her face after so much bitter weather.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other side, Crina, who will be over just a few days later this month, 20 years, is trying to relish like an emotional child.</seg>
<seg id="71">He doesn't know what to expect but he has sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.</seg>
<seg id="72">He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting they are trying to collect their thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.</seg>
<seg id="73">My parents are two mothers and two fathers.</seg>
<seg id="74">But my parents are up to the end of those who have grown me up.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's going to be a nice encounter, a wonderful experience.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now I'm so many things to say," he tells us Crina.</seg>
<seg id="77">First family reunion in Iowa</seg>
<seg id="78">In Uncle Square, under the skies of the autumn beginning, the Prairy family once again unites their destiny with their face in Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="79">Crina now has 20 years, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Cosby, her biological parents.</seg>
<seg id="80">There are no longer borders or countries, but only a barrier: That of language.</seg>
<seg id="81">Fish, with the help of an interpreter, an Italian homeowner at the centre of Isis, have easily passed.</seg>
<seg id="82">Those who managed to make this meeting say that it is the first event of this kind, and that, in the future, if there is an opportunity, they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="83">It is the first such event, which is also organised, and I am pleased to be successful.</seg>
<seg id="84">We at the Centre have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that is only dealing with consumer people, drug addicts.</seg>
<seg id="85">But we're trying to restore society something good back.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I'll be asked for such an event, I will do it with great pride," says smiling Romica Ierner, director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention, Review and Antibiotic Adventures.</seg>
<seg id="87">Behind him, Balcan's family, with Crina in the middle, are walking away.</seg>
<seg id="88">I'm understandable: They have a lot to say to each other.</seg>

<seg id="3">Camps in the PSD branch of the PSD sealed a gunshot wound to the leg.</seg>
<seg id="4">After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sprinkled by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to show a united position, the extraordinary Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Far from over, the internal war in the party appears to have taken just a break to allow combatants to draw their soul.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: You are trying to find a solution in order not to jeopardise the party.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 3 October, we have elections in the party.</seg>
<seg id="10">All functions will be made available to those who will want them.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing has been set.</seg>
<seg id="13">In October's elections, for president of the PSD's county branch, fierce competition is expected.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the short list of potential candidates for the main post in the party's outstanding branch, Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councillor Vasile Catea and interim chairman of the County Council, Victorel Lupu, are in the party.</seg>
<seg id="15">The mayor of the como Schitu lead, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to them.</seg>
<seg id="16">A decision taken in the calculation is the candidacy of the leader of PSD's county councillors, Cristian Stananov, if Lupu no longer enroll in the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader George Nichita.</seg>
<seg id="18">The list of candidates is open.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the statute, including on the day of the elections, applications can be submitted, and would not replace anyone if it happened.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will also remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new county Permanent Office and all new leadership structures," Catea said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the PSD's county branch will be secured by Victorian Lupu, a close to Nichita and Stanchev.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lupu, however, are on leave until 29 September, with the preparation of the elections to be secured by the executive secretary of the branch, County councillor Mikhail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Contacted by phone, Cristian Stananov praised the talks in recent days, leading to "a partial consensus."</seg>
<seg id="24">There is broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity in the party.</seg>
<seg id="25">A partial consensus has been reached in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.</seg>
<seg id="26">"But on the other hand, there are several options concerning the intentions of the PSD-based PSD presidency, the list remains open," Stanchev commented.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fremantle judge has refused the rapists file in Vaslui on grounds of no binary</seg>
<seg id="2">The seven young men in the NSW County convicted of rape arrive at the Iowa Court of Appeal today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vasluiinians sentenced to penalties between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their implementation today, after the basic court, Justice Prosecution, established their imprisonment immediately after sentencing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal late last week, with Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the partner of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.</seg>
<seg id="6">Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in the file.</seg>
<seg id="7">How the judges motivated the ruling</seg>
<seg id="8">Late last week, the presiding judge, who sentenced the seven youths, motivated the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">The judge discusses the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also those who supported them, saying such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The court finds that after the time being conducted under the preventive measure of judicial control, the restrictive measure of freedom but not a lack of freedom, in the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, it has been felt at the level of the local and national community with a strong sense of indignation that people accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," the motivation of the Vaslui Chamber said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The magistrates also dismantled and the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "church door."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The sublime court is not relevant to the relevance of the moral quality of the injured person, something that the defendants wanted to emphasise through the appearances they have formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the motivation said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's Future</seg>
<seg id="2">From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last few decades cannot continue the same way in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="3">By Saturday, a little world knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder to what extent it can affect our choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position position.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war Labour.</seg>
<seg id="6">The declared, anti-monarchy (asked him at one point to Tony Blair, then the prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckam Palace), a rude anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise invited regularly to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements of Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and emerge from NATO and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Things of the kind that they were saying and promised and Tsipras in Greece until the time he gave the chest to the real world and economic legalization.</seg>
<seg id="10">The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sure, some might wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who would no longer prevent such details.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of course, we can charge the blood on bankers, you become a kind of enemy of power of the Left, but as far as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the terms of Jason and Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="13">The extra sums are quickly swallowed by generous, no-cover promises made by populist demagogues.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the issue of socialism is that at one point the money of others ends."</seg>
<seg id="15">Few give real chances to Jeremy Corbyn to ever get the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who anyway wasn't as extreme in belief as the party's new leader, failed miserably in the election.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then there is still in Britain a working class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the unions were more influential than now.</seg>
<seg id="19">Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce, and extensive automakers have made the industry a massive need for high-skilled working hand, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.</seg>
<seg id="20">But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.</seg>
<seg id="21">In its latest Financial Times, the election of Corbyn increases the chances of Brexit, and Britain's exit from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the eyes of the radical Left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed the austerity of the poor.</seg>
<seg id="24">When combative this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that rocks the EU, you reach an explosive mix.</seg>
<seg id="25">And not just for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="26">But if the British decide in the wake of the referendum, which would be held by 2017, to leave the Union loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep tremors created inside it by the euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for scenarios of the most worrying.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterpoint to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant player).</seg>
<seg id="28">True, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers for the country's remaining in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are many resentment, rising in intensity even in those weeks.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a specimen in the speech by Jean Cluj by Junker, is increasingly inclined to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States, with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="32">And that's when electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptic is growing dramatically across the continent.</seg>
<seg id="33">In other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo has reached higher rates than ever in the past.</seg>
<seg id="34">Where and the conclusion the Financial Times draw when assessing Brexit's chances.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves the national interest.</seg>
<seg id="36">If voters make the decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="37">But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.</seg>
<seg id="39">Especially if, as expected, we will see more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the periphery of the interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="40">Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in oocious societies.</seg>
<seg id="41">From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same way in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="42">Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have not taken into account than the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and readiness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and damage Romania's situation.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it's hard to dismiss something from the point of view of possible scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="44">The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantin Brancusi, Sept.</seg>
<seg id="2">Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"</seg>
<seg id="3">Brancusi: "Takes and mature the workshop!"</seg>
<seg id="4">The great sculptor had a great dream: To be someone, to get famous, to hear about him all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">Behind the recount, however, is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.</seg>
<seg id="6">That something also has a name.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is called "truddles."</seg>
<seg id="8">What to write about Constantin Brancusi?</seg>
<seg id="9">What is more to say, in fact?</seg>
<seg id="10">His figure appeared on the banknotes.</seg>
<seg id="11">And recently, a well-known bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a publicity stunt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brancuand produces and deliver money nearly 60 years since it is no longer among us.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulders carrying their names.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.</seg>
<seg id="15">And when it comes out of the lads, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, at Brancuand."</seg>
<seg id="16">The country is crowded with its statuettes.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by the same world, from children, to the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.</seg>
<seg id="19">Neither the Communists managed to excel Romania's memory and culture.</seg>
<seg id="20">Its cités are today lining up the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of SMEs and SMEs.</seg>
<seg id="21">And then again, what would he actually be to say about this man?</seg>
<seg id="22">Seen from the pile of books and articles trying to recreate their destiny, Brancusi's life looks almost fantastic, totally unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="23">You know, I'm those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck to play in any big city and in a family as much as you can, your chances of success in life are almost nil.</seg>
<seg id="24">Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.</seg>
<seg id="25">And maybe that's where it would be a key.</seg>
<seg id="26">Perhaps the text that is coming from here should be started.</seg>
<seg id="27">With a sentence, however palatable they are.</seg>
<seg id="28">Uses the success stories of the creature, which will be delivered daily in newspapers and on TV.</seg>
<seg id="29">Watch the figure of this man carefully.</seg>
<seg id="30">Do you know how to succeed in life, how, today, has he heard a whole world?</seg>
<seg id="31">It is simple.</seg>
<seg id="32">He has worked all life to be someone.</seg>
<seg id="33">That's what he did.</seg>
<seg id="34">Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876 in Hobita, a small village in the Common Pestisani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, Brancusi takes a modest life, but one of which he had to reap his repertoire will guide her late-story vision.</seg>
<seg id="37">Recalling his childhood and the places where she grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, from Paris, from 1933: "On then life was beautiful and harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="38">For millennia, people were moving, happy, a patriarchal life.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was all crossed from one season to another.</seg>
<seg id="40">And do you know why things have changed?</seg>
<seg id="41">The fascination of the great city has come to us.</seg>
<seg id="42">Brancusi's Copilaria, however, was far from an idyllic one.</seg>
<seg id="43">One of the moments spent in these years of life is highly indicative of the combination of purity and violence that characterised the future sculptor years in his native country.</seg>
<seg id="44">The moment is reproduced in the "Brancusi," a biography, "written by Alexander Bujar.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1879, Constantin Brancusi had 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the autumn of that year, when the tube was made "at the Broncos," watching those who sample the liquidator to see if the process unfolds as they need, Brancusi catches a moment of general unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="47">They fill their cascades with tubes and drink on the nerves.</seg>
<seg id="48">It falls in sleep almost instantly.</seg>
<seg id="49">The first people only notice after a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="50">The mother enters the panic, then in hysteria, believing that the son had died.</seg>
<seg id="51">Towards the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from live accompanied by lauts, he sees the desperate signs of those who eagerly await him in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="52">The party is immediately turning into jale.</seg>
<seg id="53">The father is already thinking about Hull.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, someone finds that it is well based on Baba Brandusa, the sheep and servings of Brancers.</seg>
<seg id="55">Brandusa checks the baby's breath, then puts him under the bouquet of horse, gathered from the pub.</seg>
<seg id="56">The baby is strong.</seg>
<seg id="57">The world applauds.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the boy is left to sleep over the beast, of joy, the party with lenses continues with even more force.</seg>
<seg id="59">The second day, father and son meet through Orchard.</seg>
<seg id="60">Radu Brancusi puts Constantin to collect some nude and bring them up.</seg>
<seg id="61">The father captures her baby with her head down and, with the nuances brought by the boy, is knocking him out to keep her mind.</seg>
<seg id="62">And while it feels the garment of blows, the small Brancuand has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around can come down.</seg>
<seg id="63">Especially the sun's position, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he had to admit in old age, if not the Blues himself take part in the disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="64">Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father of what happened to him? "</seg>

<seg id="1">At the moment, the city doesn't work</seg>
<seg id="2">An MP calls for politicians to remember those who voted them.</seg>
<seg id="3">Independent MP Viorel Blhelp called on the PSD and PNL to stop infighting and refocus their agenda to the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we are seeing now on our political scene is a big division and both.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven't seen anything from the USL projects in 2012 to continue.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neither the highway nor a Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let us leave a little bit of politics, gather and talk.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the moment, the city is not working.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If Ed was busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blhelp said.</seg>
<seg id="10">He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the election class, with a result expected to be a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30 per cent, representing virtually the faithful electorate of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="11">The MP also believes that voters will move back to mainstream parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Ibiza" party that will be launched today.</seg>
<seg id="12">Local parties have very small chances and will only break up from the right of the right, not the PSD.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such parties rely on civic active people, who rule are right.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It turns out even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," Blhelp said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has made it clear he is not interested in a bid for upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to enroll in the mayoral race.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have said that I do not want to run for any local office.</seg>
<seg id="17">I am thinking of whether to continue as a Member and in the future term.</seg>
<seg id="18">I tried to call for unity for ISIS and in the discussions on the hallway, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make my picture.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't want, but we can't go on like that anymore.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If people voted to us, it doesn't mean they are fools to vote on us if they don't see anything," Blhelp said, who appreciated that the main reason the electorate no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the almonds.</seg>
<seg id="21">A colleague from Tatarasi said he didn't get his money and he has to go by bus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let us not be hypocritical.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is no money.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sometimes I feel ashamed to raise the money from Cairns.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the end of the term I will make a report with everything that we have spent, outside the salaries of employees from the cabinet and its maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="26">It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lions, with all the transport breaks, accommodation and the others.</seg>
<seg id="27">"To tell an MP that they don't get their money to clean hypocrisy," Blhelp concluded.</seg>
