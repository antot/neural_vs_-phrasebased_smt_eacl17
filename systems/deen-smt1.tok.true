in an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits
in an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was it important to stress that his `` sweet dog '' but still live and probably was excited , and he said that the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss , a handwritten note , scribbled on a white block : `` I am so sorry , I wanted to , I could make it back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . '' This was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , 300 miles already went to the school grounds , according to the police , a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office was shot and killed .
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m. heard .
he said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took her own life when the police einkesselte him .
a day after the shootings at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb .
the investigators at both ends of the state released details , as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him , helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said that they were happy with his teaching .
the police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him , in which he spoke of the `` beautiful people '' with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose teaching staff consists of 17 members , and many students attended classes from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors .
a student , Brandon Beavers , praised Lamb , said he seemed a little too excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
another student , Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress .
lamb had the Delta State University , asked for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year , he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard , for it does not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , of course , but `` there was something in Mr. Lambs idea . ''
these are questions that can no longer answer Lamb .
after fleeing the campus police later found Lambs when he could back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
before he could be arrested Lamb killed , selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
his car was still in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of approximately 12,000 and taught geography and pedagogy .
he received his doctorate in education in the spring .
one of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla hair tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar .
he was then the women swarm .
all the girls melted away when he was there , `` said hair tone , now 40 , and in the suburb of Brandon Jackson resident .
lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together .
in an emergency , Lamb said , `` I 've killed my wife , '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
you had a dog named Lightning , with them in the brick house , located on a Bayou in Gautier .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O 'Steen , said that they had been divorced 15 years ago , but have remained friends and had a daughter , now 19 years old .
`` She was totally devastated , '' O 'Steen said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o 'Steen said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Abigail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played guitar .
lamb met Prentiss , as he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair .
later , they played a gig .
o 'Steen said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said that he and Lamb Prentiss Night at night 5 September saw for the last time , after Lamb , his guitar and harmonica playing stopped in front of a sparse audience had ended .
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
we were laughing and joking with each other the clean up .
I think they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first-year seminar program , specialising in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee .
at Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community participate in a candle-light ceremony .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil , the university choir `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` Amazing Grace '' while singing .
the classes will resume on Wednesday .
`` We are trying to encourage our students to return , '' said upon .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and Lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married .

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the top echelons of surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump with a double-digit lead , and some begin to seriously ask what it 's chances for the nomination of the real-estate mogul .
of course , it is still too early in the term .
no one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts stress that it was at this time in 2011 by Rick Perry 's leadership to the rising Herman Cain , none of which also won only one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outsider groups such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump 's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him .
here are some recent poll numbers , which indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase .
Trump 's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , showed a poll by Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans , the real estate mogul was positive .
by mid-July , there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
about three in ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump .
two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the GOP candidate .
in a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they were either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if Trump were nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm about how Trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters said they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' when Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate said .
a majority of Republicans see Trump 's temperament is not a problem .
while Donald Trump is widely known for his bombastic and insulting statements is criticized , 52 percent of the Republicans , but Irish voters that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies to the first pre-election state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent said that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
if they put their scholars hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week , four out of ten that Trump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
full disclosure : GOP voters had in the past , not the clearest crystal ball .
at this stage in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination , compared to only 28 % were for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
however , it appears that a large number of GOP voters , Trump 's campaign as a plausible .
even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the splintered field probably contributes to Trump 's leadership , while the anti-Trump-support to more than a dozen other candidates distributed is diffuse .
but a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates , Trump is reaping the majority support .
he has a 13-point lead over Carly Fiorina , Marco Rubio 14 points before Walker 15 points , 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
a slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds .
a new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump , saying that they have given their votes .
of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say never to change their opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
still , Trump 's strongest competitors at the moment , the other outsiders , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have made up their minds are twice as often for Trump .
six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration .
since then , Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico as `` rapists '' who called immigration , was the lynchpin in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispanics from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the Neuorientierungs-efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday said six out of 10 Republicans , with Trump on immigration issues .
so , as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will also do Donald Trump apparently .
the frustration with the government climbs to new highs .
on Donald Trump and Ben Carson , now accounts for around half of the support from Republican voters , especially by their outsider status .
six out of 10 Republicans said Monday in the new ABC / Post poll , they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago , shows that three out of four Iowa 's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress are `` dissatisfied '' with 54 percent and 21 percent use extreme caution `` angry . ''

`` We will not underestimate them , '' said Bayern-Gunners captain before the game at the Stadium before Zoltan 31.688 heißblütigen fans promised - and kept the word .
they showed a focused and committed vision to shine without .
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class , including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus .
in 2011 , Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stumbled here .
but the Bayern , in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated champion , did not want to be the next victim .
they went ran bravely in their offensive efforts , but often too unimaginative .
the attacks were launched by game too often shift to left Douglas Costa , which occurred against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller had more luck from the right , swung his flank from the right-field in the upper left Toreck .
in the 67th minute of the world champion gave the possible 2-0 .
the best opportunities in the first half , Robert Lewandowski .
first of all , the expense-striker Ideye Brown 's header beat the Poles from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct inspection , the goalkeeper Roberto parierte with the knee ( 35th ) .
although the Bayern game raise their usual dominantes , Piraeus acupuncture could do .
on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relied upon .
for example , when he has a shot of the bar drew Ideye ( 56th ) .
before Neuer Guardiola could defend a chain with four Preußen in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario idol , back to what problems in the squad , sat outside .
the World Cup hero was only after completing training given the green light , said sporting director Matthias Sammer in `` Sky '' : `` If you want to turn it into something else that is evil . ''
the first change Guardiola decided against him , as he did for the beleaguered Kingsley Coman Lewandowski ( 59th ) .
Idol late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 ) , and 13 minutes later made it clear that Muller was a penalty on another .
before the game , it had arrived at the stadium to riots .
after a smaller group of partly vermummten Bayern fans in their viewers seem to block the followers of Piraeus hosts with words and gestures had provoked , attacked the police and went with batons against the Munich supporters .
at least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
smokers not only harms the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study in Potsdam .
the good news : the risk of abandonment is falling fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
it emerges from the long-term study by an international team of researchers , including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .

for these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor , the authors say .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss , go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries .
people who stop smoking , reduce their risk , but within a short period of time , `` the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research . ''
however , it could take more than ten years until the threat to Sinke back to the level of non-smokers , said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham , England .
we need to convince people to be non-smokers , study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE declared : `` Smoking shortens the life . ''
not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge is good to a good dental health well into old age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population over the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness , DIfE said .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP before
to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system proposed .
the controversial private mediation services for disputes between corporations and governments should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is in its operation significantly more traditional dishes .
`` We want to set up a system where the public trust , '' stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström , responsible for the idea .
the Swede has plans to introduce the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
by TTIP is the world 's largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbitration specifically see that the EU countries and the US together independent judges to select a new investment law .
you should come in equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
a second instance is also provided for the first time .
it would allow to make appeals against judgments .
so far , the procedure involved agreed among themselves on a referee , an appeal against their sentences , there was not .
in the discussion of the past few months is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice can not be trusted , `` said Malmström .
in the long term , she wants to work for an international investment court .
also , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the especially large corporations required investor-state arbitration ( ISDS ) is considered as one of the main reasons for the strong opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which businesses can only compensation at the expense of taxpayers , nullify national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact , the EU Commission 's proposals as insufficient .
criticism that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) was especially .
the German economy , State Secretary Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission has to say on the reform of key points , the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up .
the old system of private arbitration is off the table .
the French government has welcomed the plans of Malmström .
the European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by it .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear .
the negotiations since mid-2013 .
the issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States .
originally a framework should stand for the agreement as early as the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer tenable .

eleven years ago a sceptic on stage in Cologne Prime Club ( now sits : Luxor ) .

the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stevens .
he told through various places that he always einzeichnet back on the map , which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs .
where they are and how it looks there , in his home country .
since then , Stevens turns out to be a wonderfully creative madman .
with the 2003 and third album `` Greetings From Michigan : the Great Lake State '' composed songs that can harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties snuggle , but opulent always drifting into the great seem wise .
there is a rumour , `` Michigan '' would be the first part of a series of audacious : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row .

the album is a rise in the American Billboard charts and is lacking in any year best list of influential music media .
after a very productive experiments Stevens uses on `` The Age of Adz '' ( 2010 ) very comprehensive electronic set pieces .
this sixth studio album orchestrated is still wide , but driven by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and Hall .

although now nearly 2,000 guests sit glued to their chairs , which has become a much more mature Stevens returns to the intimacy and the folk .
without a word to say to the audience , a group of excellent musicians is enriched by the album .
we hear from the audience : the lecture was `` opulent '' and thus you can basically throw away the `` plate . ''
it was only thanks to an encore Stevens modest plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bowed its head to a barrage of applause .
Jeremy Corbyn 's debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time
since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut is expected at the Prime Minister 's Question Time with
the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to his debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time , and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Corbyn will gather for the first of his six questions set out shortly after noon , with his performance of the media and probably the Labour MEPs will be examined closely .
he called for `` less theatrical and more facts '' at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could skip some meetings to leave to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn 's leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC 's annual conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence , criticism from a number of Tory most recent provoked and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem , has drawn attention to
a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had `` stood in respectful silence '' and he had acknowledged the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . ''
but a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith told BBC Two 's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader , to sing the national anthem , `` independent '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn 's top team , and they rely on differences in economic , defense and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
the BBC 's political correspondent Robin Charles says that political differences within Labour `` pile up '' after Mr Corbyn 's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits .
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour changes present to the whole idea of a limit to remove altogether .
hours later , said Mr. Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , that the party was `` very clear '' that it was only against the government 's plans , the cap of £26,000 to £23,000 .
Mr Corbyn is the fifth to be Labour leader , David Cameron , the Tory leader , in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House , is facing .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he `` Crowd-sourced '' ideas for questions for Mr Cameron , he has more than 30,000 comments were made .
the Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister 's Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will both repartee `` and refrain from arguing with the barbs and has instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow business minister , will represent him , if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak occasionally , and that he had contacted John Bercow , the Speaker of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is out of politics in the style of a `` Ditherer-theatre '' to remove , which is often associated with the Prime Minister 's Question Time , but a few years later , he admitted that he had failed it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons , and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that she had become a caricature , and needs far-reaching reforms .

Metcash Bodenständigkeits launches campaign to combat Aldi- invasion
Metcash tries , the IGA stores from Aldi-march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesaler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million to defend Aldi-invasion .
while Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as through events such as Adelaide show .
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Duns Borough in IGA stores samples distributed and shopkeepers , the cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy , published on September 29 , when the wholesalers for food , drink and equipment-Strategietag conducts its annual investors .
there is a lot at stake , with South Australia and Western Australia , nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and higher profit margins than the IGA network Metcashs Oststaaten generate .
purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaaten .
however , as Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi 12 months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players , but mostly independent retailers will take away sales .
in a report published this week shows that the estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath , IGA retailers $ 360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 , could lose .
this prediction is based on the assumption that in the next year , Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery store and the quantities on Metcash Metcashs high fixed-cost base could be around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
at the same time is losing market share in the Metcash Oststaaten , mainly at Aldi and Coles , although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers today Douglass , founder of Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade , Metcash .
Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass .
but it is assumed that a director of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGas is market share since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Metcashs food and food trade , which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , the operational debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholesaler is resisting and invested more than $ 150 million to date and sale price with Coles in hundreds of products every week , align and IGA retailers to improve their stores by faster-growing fresh food to improve and better selection of private-label foods .
Metcashs Chief Executive Ian Ferrin says that the price adjustments and store-rehabilitation programs to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years , will return to profit growth .
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the president of the Association of Tennis Australia , Steve Healy praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as the `` Special Ks , '' came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
in a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee , with Harrison stated : `` Kyrgios beat Wawrinka would have to , and I should beat the child . ''
while he was last seen , as he smashed a tennis racquet after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group of thwarted , Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy .
the teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind an artist 's Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain .
`` One thing that I 'm quite ereifere is the fact that , in my view , Thanasi was embroiled in the dispute , '' Healy said .
he has broken a racquet when he Krampfes due to a lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken , Thanasi and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of .
but , really , he was in the US Open have behaved extremely well , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19-year-old , he works extremely hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing area , he trained hard , he is in good form , he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits .
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios at the important precedent , which starts on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as a right for all , but he assures the man from Canberra , as an integral part of a long-term return to the team. ``
`` First of all , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [ Kyrgios ] , Healy said .
and I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , we try to explain to him the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think , is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe 's refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closing the border , refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stuck all who tried to come into the country illegally , all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man 's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints and built tents and settled there .
but frustrations grew .
as a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants chanted `` open the borders ! '' And screaming insults against the Hungarian riot police .
some had food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister , said that it was `` unacceptable '' that migrants from Hungary were returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage .
it must take place in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries , `` Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge , they expressed their hope that finally , next month , or until the end of the year , an agreement was reached that EU states further 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , would resume .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union , to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary , however , was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
the state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they were able to seal off roads and speeding up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race , the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , have been used .
in recent months , many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted , however , that most of the economic refugees are arriving in search of a better life and not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view very much at odds with other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , making the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of the 4-meter ( 13-foot ) high fence which the government along the southern border with Serbia was build to a crime . these laws also give higher sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Because of the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand , '' said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
procedurally , the parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already .
Gyorgy Bakondi , national-security adviser to Orban , said that 45 people authorities while trying to cross the border caught , 15 others were already penetrated deep into the country .
you come across as they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and the committing of crimes are accused under the new laws .
authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders .
confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians a small office opened in a metal container , in order to process the data from people and a crowd of people pressed to hineinzudrängen there .
20 managed to get it , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll , halved
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent previously , while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent ( an increase of 17 percent .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for president , the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries .
more than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support .
but Clinton 's supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
since the CBS News poll showed Clinton with a range of demographic groups , while Sanders has achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a wide lead among women and moderates , but these canopies have diminished .
their support for the men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton 's advantage among Democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now at the same level .
Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead over the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 per cent they would only support because she is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton 's current supporters are particularly thrilled by it .
the views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton , only about a quarter would enthusiastically support .
while 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be President ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
of Clinton 's supporters , including her relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited .
since the vice president casts a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although one-third believes that he should not do it .
if the Democratic primary voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice , Biden is at the top .
for more than half of Clinton 's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton is ahead of Sanders by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Biden , a second is by far in this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the `` most eligible '' has risen .
nevertheless , the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about eligibility .
similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party 's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics with voters .
majorities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy , and with strong leadership .
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty , Clinton 's strength is in the lead .
thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , and 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters in the primaries , Clinton , Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views .
in all of these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders .
since questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State will continue to be asked , are the most Democratic voters in the primaries is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about one-third are satisfied .
public opinion on this issue was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , divided .
most Americans said that the e-mail controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion of her was even worse .
they are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall , only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May .
62 % of voters do not believe it is an honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters nationwide see also Trump as not honest and not trustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks for leadership .
of the six candidates tested Biden , Carson and Bush are doing best with honesty .
a majority of Sanders looks rather than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson is in nationwide poll close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest poll from CBS News / New York Times behind Donald Trump
the two candidates for half the support of voters in the new poll , and the other is now dramatically lose to stop
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers , and the support is growing by 23 % in a recent CBS poll from Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the poll on Tuesday .
but Carson shot over the same period , from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Carson arrives in demographic groups and Trump among Republican voters than with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich , is with Wisconsins governor Scott Walker teed off , the deepest fell by 10 % support in the last month to 2 % now .
former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio with 6 % in the third place .
the margin of error for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / ORC poll , which was released last week , shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he ends up with 19 % support among Republicans , behind Trump with 32 % support .
the recent poll by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson .
facing a last week ascending Carson , Trump found some pages blows for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump 's faith in question .
`` We need energy , '' said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing is enough for a trip to the Mediterranean to find more hot water .
a bath in the North and Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather short .
some will not go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DWD ) with shares .
water temperatures , by contrast , offers the Mediterranean : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are in the top 25 degrees to 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Baruch College-newcomer charged
nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual bullying in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , to be filed murder charges against five people .
members of New York 's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood attacked Chun `` Michael '' Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 to brutal and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .
officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged , and have been repeatedly attacked while he tried on a frozen field to reach a goal .
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , according to the police .
but you had the time to change Deng 's clothes to googled his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng , the national president of the Brotherhood , in order to obtain advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
`` At this point , the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood were fundamentally about what Michael Deng , '' Police Chief Wagner said .
he could not be revived , and he died of his injuries the next morning .
according to an autopsy report Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head , trunk and legs .
`` Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood , and at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment , '' said Douglas Fier Berg , a lawyer representing Deng 's family , in a statement .
congregations , and its members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
a Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr. Meng , also be charged with religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation .
`` We want to make not only the individuals involved , but if there is one organisation that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this , so we will also be accountable for this , '' said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group .
this will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike is coming , and the boom will falter , as bond yields will rise , and the economy is sliding into a recession .
what we know .
what we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months .
the aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial system .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for normalization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could see that all the fuss was exaggerated , perhaps because of a rate increase .
`` The Fed 's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of '' cheap money , `` Julian Jessop , economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a low level , the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here 's a look based on historical trends , as some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticipation of rate hikes could make things volatile for a while .
once it arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
`` There seems to be a tendency for asset returns of 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be undermined , perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy , '' said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happened after the Fed 's interest-rate increases .
more specifically , the market is mostly over the last 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike , pretty flat over the next 250 days ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average rate of return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis , Bob Doll , chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management , published in Barron 's .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle , and thus increase the yield begins to decrease .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote interest rate hikes .
in the current case , the Fed is faced with a number of conditions , which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession .
most remarkable is that GDP is near its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed .
according to Deutsche Bank 's nominal GDP stood at 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent , only a few , and we expect that this will continue in the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed just 1.5 percent .
interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of `` whether it is different this time , '' said Deutsche Bank .
market participants throughout the year on a rate hike by the Fed have been taken , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC increased could approve during this session , the futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
`` In our study , all have cycles increase from 1950 to today in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade provided , '' according to the report .
in contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
the current cycle is by far the longest , the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and there have been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile , because the market is anticipating a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if the change their strategic direction .
with bond yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
at the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause bond yields between longer and shorter closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve .
high-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still cautious , to expect higher yields , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed-income analyst at Schwab , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones believes that the markets are already in Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spreads have widened and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the Fed tightened its strategy .
by and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
`` History shows that '' quality `` stocks tend , three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively , '' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients .
companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on average , by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality ( by an average of 4 percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew Bingham
the Conservative member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its `` dumbing down ''
he argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
he was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The bathrooms smelt
House-colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` turns '' to Classic FM , a leading member of parliament and new claims increased pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private sector do not .
the Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the BBC bosses that public service radio station `` verdumme '' and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial rivals .
`` Radio 3 seems to be - I use the word '' verdummen `` not like - but it seems to turn on Classic FM , '' he said .
he was also on the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be The bathrooms smelt just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only `` imitate what is already on the market , said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , which I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and new works , I think is really important , '' he said .
earlier this year , Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that should be working harder to engage the audience argued the BBC , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , it came under fire , commercial rivals on the feet .
the Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show on the BBC , the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million was purchased .
take a look at why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - `` on a special BBC way '' was produced .
he added that he wished that the company `` is a hit from our barn , '' when we start the next time an entertainment series .
however , he refused to order for another series of The Voice in the future , or to exclude the fee payers money for other entertainment formats .

the decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
the world is watching , if the US Federal Reserve in two days , Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision to make , whether for the first time in nearly a decade , the interest rates will be raised or not .
a survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half who only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so , now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero .
`` For the first time , we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-field and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start , '' said Angel Ubide , chief researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is in a relatively good performance , trillion will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of inflation .
however , the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move .
the decision is at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced
shooter at the Delta State University has left a letter of apology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day before he wrote his colleagues shot and killed Shannon Lamb - a note to say that we do him `` sorry '' at the first murder and he wanted to know `` can make it disappear , '' authorities said on Tuesday .

I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me. ``
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night , as police umzingelten him .
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , of course , but `` there was something in Mr. Lambs idea . ''

Prentiss has been described by Shawn O 'Steen , who testified that they were married about seven years , as a `` good man . ''
the two were divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .

Knowles said that Prentiss , who had a dog named Lightning met , for about three years ago with Lamb .
`` She always wanted to help other people , '' said Knowles
the police said that Lamb phoned relatives at some point on Monday to tell them , `` he will not go to jail . ''
when police heard him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night Lamb drove his car , fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg .
while this brought the left side defenders cry and it was ruled out for at least six months from the games , Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area collapsed .
he was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital . ''
he will be moved tomorrow , or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , then it is very difficult and great plays , and then this happens .
in the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask on .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play again this season .
Moreno was lucky to escape a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , was not punished the Mexicans .
van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both feet .
a tweet on Shaw 's account was : `` Thank you all for your messages , words can not describe how broken I am , my road to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . ''
this Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw related : during the defeat at PSV
the England defender has with the European Championship in France an extra incentive to recover until next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : `` It is a very serious violation . ''
if a player leaves with this kind of violation of the place are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team played in the World Cup in 2014 .
`` It is very difficult because it was not his intention to injure the opponent , and then when you hear that it is a very serious violation , it is not good , '' Cocu said .
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see the ball , which was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him [ Moreno ] , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SBS6 Moreno said : `` I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
the PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling .
surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better ?
there is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
as a provider of childcare systems was asked his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax , published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. / he .
it is a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company super camps , and continues : `` It was funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I read to my children , because it always seems to be an image or a message that we 've been missing . ''
all well and good , except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , but a summary of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to the relatively short text .
`` In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where all nature is gone and the air is a commodity , is hoping for a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree , '' reads one . Dr. / he was a love interest , whose real name was Theodor / he hostage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that were n't suspicious enough : the text proposed by Cameron reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax 's film , on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and so begins : `` In the walled city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams to win . ''
although he admits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar , hears an unnamed boy , as the local environment by the greedy , trees cases , Thneed knitting Once-ler , despite the protests of the name Lorax , Hock , schnurrbärtigen nature , `` that '' speaks on behalf of the trees , is devastated .
most likely , it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper , The Lorax not 20 times in a row , read to a child .
a Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably come from Cameron 's constituency office .
Super camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team , but it is still difficult
against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if the squad that was selected for the tour of England , is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card .
`` I would not rule out a victory .
Alastair Cook 's side may have less than three years ago , but there are good players of spin in the batting and fielding , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars of 2012 , only a youthful , positive attitude .
with the ball , Moeen Ali as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
in related news : Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex was .
the decision to leave Adam Lyth , of course , is for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire .
in his seven Tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , that led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser .
long ago , it would have extended the run of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire , another chance .
the England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he is not so good services , and this does not surprise me ; he is first and foremost a team man .
the question of how much time a test-shot man gets to his character , is difficult .
Lyth had seven chances - as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine .
only Compton got the chance to play home and away .
the only criticism I can make is that England was Jonathan routine first began in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex disaster comes in , and he is a man , and I have .
he is an X-Factor-cricketers in Yorkshire we saw early in this season , when he 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch was what hit us .
he must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this of course depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Moeen alongside Cook beat what an extra spin-bowler and provide four Quicks would receive , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a man could not beat , and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious bastard of cricket players .
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop , before he appeared in 2001 as an opener .
he has managed three hundred runs immediately and not looked back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
people might look at his statistics , an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball - and think it 's a punt , but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Sri Lanka batsman out , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience , having played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood for the white-ball stage of the tour and will bring energy and a powerful presence in the setup .
I always felt that he was on the international cricket competition is created , as a player or as a coach , and how he had Mahela insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with the previously said .
Collys teammate at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not in the one-dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and , for my part , I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team director do not determine the timetable .
and you must remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results .
such decisions are taken not with a light heart .
the Brexit camp = Brexit ( British exit from the EU ) are gaining popularity as the economy by the year 2017 is in the doldrums
David Cameron 's half-baked Neuverhandlungs Strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU , with each day deeper into trouble , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy `` Is it yes or no ? '' Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC , because Europe was renowned on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Corbyn 's and Nigel Farage 's .
a European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states , so deeply enmeshed in various crises , such as the EU , it is now , and not always through their own fault , Britain 's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they are not usually like that .
in Brighton , the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may not be them if they threaten social protection .
we could also have Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb summits and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
it is always about me .
my European friend , an outwards-looking Britain inside the EU tent wants - `` Let us not just with France , '' says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals came to the point where it is no matter to them , whether we stay or go .
Germany 's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , such as lunchtime of those like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand and Kohl ( 14 ) ( 16 is in the overly long ) .
France 's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a declining force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain left .
it is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-Britons , whose energy should be used more , Scotland 's exit from the UK - to prevent something they may not want to , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so maybe some of these ministers are planning even deliberately unhelpful comments , SNP-style , while Britain 's referendum campaign in 2017 , in order to accelerate the process of Brexit , thought my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a bust , '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did during the referendum in 1975 , inspired by Tony Benn were not , however , that our entry in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore-euro opportunists , who has a reputation as an EU `` straight bananas '' Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s .
for all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
this included a medley of tax-fearing-rogue , phone-hack of foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers .
Tony Blair really thought much about it , but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distributed bananas to distract him , rather than on his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he resisted Cameron 's referendum , because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU Constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , he opened the back door .
the press has never forgiven him. ``
but the nice Jeremy Corbyn , of me in Westminster on Monday for a friendly slap on the back - I told him that he had no time for me to waste need - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock 's boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now .
it may be , but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win over the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyn 's official position on Europe is - I express it politely - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , most people outside of UKIPs traditional blue dye-tendency and the wilder climes of Tories Klein-Engländerismus can say yes to everyone .
it is to admit it , `` said Hilary Benn , not a Bennite '' Benn on the radio and on television this week , when the Scouts fought in it , not that Corbyn 's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father on television what , disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his Cabinet job .
Hilarys fight was even more attractive .
but struggling to remain `` under any circumstances '' - Benns - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC and his colleagues told delegates after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening .
whatever the mawkish bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that even he has moved me - news-discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock , and , above all , in the maelstrom of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
it is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe , which allows him to Labour 's support in the referendum campaign to keep a foregone conclusion , as McDonnell , it said .
sure Simon Jenkins thinks so .
but McDonnell and Corbyn 's fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy , its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of small difference a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
as with all its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors .
why Paris or Berlin should waste political capital - they have to make distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British , if anything can be meaningless ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the Tory government in power , how do I start on Monday was reminiscent of something , which is called British Influence Security Forum .
experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
a government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , joined in the Lancet , by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarettes are used as evidence .
PHE report published the `` principle '' last month and describes him as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . ''
but some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data , and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extremely windy basis , '' reasoned on the PHE his main conclusion .
two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations `` on stone or sand build up . ''
Martin McKee , professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape , Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
you said that the public expects of PHE 's assertion that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking '' on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling are based .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to make a model of a multi-criteria decision analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by a variety of nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , whose CEO is earlier by British American Tobacco ( BAT ) to have an independent study .
he also signed the credentials of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers , but not the funding , which he previously after reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received , she added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied , but that includes several well-known e-cigarette-champions , some of whom even an industry funding in the paper .
some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting , also took the tobacco-of PHE .
the research group `` significantly , '' recognizes that there is a lack of hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria , `` wrote , McKee and Cape .
but none of these compounds or restrictions in the PHE report discussed .
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that `` there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and wellbeing at PHE , said that it was responding to the allegations by the BMJ earlier .
he said : `` E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . ''
every second lifelong smokers dies of his addiction .
all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison , but we still have to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the health service £2 billion per year .
the clear proof of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking , are we fulfilling our national jurisdiction .
the BBC should give up Eastenders , former head of Channel 4 says
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used in order to make the kind of programmes that are not by other UK broadcasters .
he criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in solid window against the most popular shows of its rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do , Johnson said that he was six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried , without success , to get in touch with the BBC .
`` I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts which are clearly non-subsidized rivals would be shown , '' said Johnson , the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the licence fee , which I consider medium- or long-term is not a good idea , you should at least give its production programs that others do not .
send The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show , this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be funded without subsidies .
the Voice is such a programme , Eastenders is another , admittedly , both in-house productions .
frankly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings `` because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
his comments on the BBC 's most popular programmes are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows such as Eastenders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes to BBC4 `` should go where you can measure the audience not quite , but they do their job , and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees go , '' Well , of course , we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. ``
you put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
the broadcasting fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value .
of course , you all think we all think that for £150 per year , here is a great value , but for people who are £150 is a lot of money , whether that is true wonder , because they do n't consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform , educate and entertain. ``
he said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be on the public television channels in Australia and Canada are an example of this change to `` inform , educate and entertain . ''
on the issue of partnerships Elstein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online .
`` Sono Genetics ' may control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by explosions of sound waves .
the tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that the threshold of human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard .
the impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
further on this subject : read and write brain activity with light .
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called sono Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms .
the enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures , the TRP-4 called ion channels in the membranes of cells , some of the worms are found .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , according to a report in Nature Communications .
by ultrasound-controlled nematodes to create genetically modified Chalasani , the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels .
if he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified motor neurons .
the procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics , a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off .
but Chalasani said that sono Genetics may have some advantages over this technology .
unlike light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through unimpeded and tissue in the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make , '' said Chalasani .
other applications could be on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells , he added .

the ads shame Britain 's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-arms trade fairs-video .
terrible killer-drones !
ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles !
cluster bombs !
and electric shock sticks , causing the nagging pain , but leave no trace !
the cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world 's biggest arms fair is a combative parody , which was produced by Amnesty International , the willingness of the British government in the spotlight to bring arms to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International event at the ExCeL Centre in London 's Docklands to bestow gifts .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters at bus stops and in subway trains are to see and which require a second look .
`` Important announcement : go from 15 to 18 September with the DLR ? '' ( Docklands Light Railway ) , one reads in the characters of the London Underground and the DLR line , which converts the image of a tank .
in September , a swarm of arms dealers will take the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland .
a group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribution in London and used `` Ad Space Hack Pack , '' a £6 -Pack of Inbusschlüsseln , by claiming that `` access to around a third of the bus-advertising space on the planet gain . ''
transport for London is the Plaka animal `` vandalism '' is not funny .
one of the parody ads , which was produced by the Special Patrol Group .
after Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will be critical and try to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries .
many artists with activists in protest movements at the work and say that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti-arms-posters greets the commuters on the subway .
the Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , the non-profit organization with the graphic designer and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL-calendar - and thought : `` We give them the campaign that they try to avoid . ''
they played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy corporate advertising , but `` by the dinned into with bright colors and animation , it remains more liable . ''
`` You have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the exhibition to raise , '' says Tom Davies , of Amnesty .
what we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the field within ExCeL , where exhibitors fantastic euphemistische products bestow gifts .

this includes a `` uniquely shaped warhead , the outstanding effect after-effects inside the target returns . ''

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year-old into student housing , still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the strained smile of those I 've annoyed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned , can be distilled into eight simple rules .
in the student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying .
it is tempting to chat about : people , where you are coming from , and where you 've taken sabbatical , where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you Marmite `` frankly neither love nor hate , because seriously guys , it 's only a yeast extract hahaha , I 'm in my room .
you breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it steers the conversation and helps you to find the people you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak , even if your eyelashes were caught on fire and the fire extinguisher .
let people .
the rooms of people turning into drink-receptions , movie-night venues and local venues , but they are also the places where people dress up and her underwear back .
related to this : you do n't start thinking about at the university with a relationship
introverted get a rough treatment at the university .
your bedroom should be a haven , but many student residences form a room-to-room-stroll-culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship .
it can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture that allows you to say , `` I love you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to leave so that I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you . ''
try to feel when the marshals is weary of sociability - and you will send an SMS knocking him .
speaking of knock on the door : do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a locked door was not an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by baking .
since the university at the height of the Back-mania , is the knock on the doors of people with a plate of brownies , less strange than the greeting of the 1950 's `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I 've baked you something . and now , please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . ''
homemade offer is a good way to strike up new friendships .
her housemates feel obliged to talk and perhaps eventually will associate your face with a tasty morsel .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
badly mixed clumps of flour , sugar and fat cause people are sleeping , if you knock on the door .
to steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the claws of chicken is a theft , but it is the Milchs take a drop in your tea ?
check with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone steals your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , dissuading people from sleeping or at work .
it is not just a matter of being a decent human being , but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb about the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbour to ask whether it makes them something a little quieter drum & bass , because it 's three o'clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stop at 5 p.m. , they let their neighbours kindly sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring , their door graduated and embarked on their three-hour exam .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would randomly collected in the same student housing ?
conversely , it would be deeply embarrassed if you keep your future as a resident assistant , a special feature to separate them , and then they have to see every day , and maybe see how it moves across all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way , but if a resident assistant is definitely not your future , try at least to persuade your body a little common sense .
leave In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has not verschlossenem his keys in his room , the line between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems .
a good prank is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a boomerang .
submit by hiding a valuable lesson about safety and amusing - but you never to flood someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
you are closing their doors , and put the key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but you see tackern their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low-income earners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` Wohnhraum need not only refugees , but also the single mother and the low earners . ''
`` I show how you still can build cheap and good , '' says the 44-year-old in an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing on the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : the mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
because the people here are to a large extent .
in view of the refugees , we also need enough housing in the next few decades .
a very facile , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : a terraced house needs less space .
it facilitates the integration .
it is different when you are among the people who live in apartment buildings .
each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments , each for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs .
what is the cost ?
Gildner : the price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without a plot .
this is manageable .
took six months of construction .
this is appropriate .
the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gildner : planning , I have learned through my project .
particularly complicated there is always the looming sword of Damocles and expect the pitch regulation .
creepy. ``
it is still assumed that anyone who creates in a terraced house with three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities of the lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents reacted to her terraced house project ?
Gildner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : it is true that we have had in the last five years , a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more .
my project has the message that the ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low earners .
I show how you can still build cheap and good .
that is what it is .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analyses .
iOS 9 : how do you get the new iPhone operating system , when Apple released update

to get around this problem , users are encouraged to wait either , dates back to the rush or to try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this could potentially mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it through the streamlining of the updates less likely , and it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install it once the process is completed .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade , or is located near a battery charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the charge is too low , Apple does not mean that the update will continue , because the phone could possibly halfway switched off and lead to a breakdown of the updates .

Croatia : `` We let the refugees ''
`` Now the border controls at our southern border , high risk , '' said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
the checks at the Hungarian border , in parallel remain upright .
still it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum , that `` of course '' could make .
the care and safety of the people standing in the foreground .
it is clear , however , that `` it needs clear signals , '' said the minister .
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not on the Austrian-Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering `` corridor '' - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would allow refugees to travel to Austria and Germany , and also may create corridors for the refugees .
just saw this interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana .
the idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable , '' Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary .
the border with Croatia was an external border of the Schengen area , however , is already heavily controlled .
as the minister stressed that Slovenia wants to seal its borders to refugees .
`` Each EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried Tuesday night to enter the Eastern Tovarnik / Sid , to avoid registration .
the Croatian police was able to take them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik since then .
it is mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
, emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees , what Interior Minister Ranko said .
there were buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border , the migrants to the Hungarian border , had redirected towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was they who Anweise people to take certain routes : `` Neither we , nor do we want to do this , '' it said .
according to the media reports , however , was the first bus arrived in the morning with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the inmates were all night , around 500 kilometers away from the Macedonian border with Serbia .
`` We have heard that Hungary has closed down , so the police told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
you wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
so could it actually to observers already predicted shift of previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a nearby stretch a little further .
Croatia : `` Comprehensive opportunities for border control . ''
Croatia 's Interior Minister what had previously said that his country had prepared in case of a large influx of refugees , the plans for possible emergency situations .
he gave no details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member `` comprehensive opportunities for border control ' .
we carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia this since 2007 , the EU partners provide the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls .
on the Serb side about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings and Horgos Backi Breg continue to be blocked completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to move now to the Croatian border , is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos : he thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , is premature .
it would not be very large numbers of refugees .
it could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aides to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes rates
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps where alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless , however : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region .

ecumenical hospice help Mannheim has been around for 20 years
around the Mannheim Paradeplatz threads you might want .
people do their errands , sometimes fast , sometimes a breath .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim auto salons at the Paradeplatz .
city cars .
vibrant , long life on a lovely late autumn sunshine and four large panels , each with the title `` Before I die I want to ... . ''
the Ecumenical hospice help with this action on its 20-year anniversary and is still faced with mixed reactions .
`` It comes to life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and the people , '' said Josefine Lammer .
the head of the Ecumenical hospice care is the passers-by and available for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
while a passerby to chalk up some spontaneous and the phrase `` in my life , '' `` read , '' with the campers in the United States , `` '' stop the war `` or '' not `` suffer long , others are short , read , I say phrases like '' I am not yet so far `` and then go further .
again , small discussions evolve on the fringes of the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
even Peter Hübinger is on the ground .
`` Only if I am clear that for me comes at the end of the world , I can live responsibly , '' the director of outreach work in Mannheim , which is working with the Caritas Association of Ecumenical hospice help says .
so is this high-profile action on the 20-year-olds .
not that anyone wants to be on the boards say publicly is understandable , however , because it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and dying is still fraught with taboos , so the experience of Josefine Lammer , although the hospice movement in recent years have contributed a great deal to allow people to open up .

FedEx mixed results , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for the year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service .
the company also said that it plans to about 55,000 seasonal workers hired for the holidays .
at this time last year , FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the shares fell more than 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year , which ends next May , 20 cents less than its previous forecast .
analysts were expecting , according to a poll by FactSet 10,84 $ .
the lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which are collected in November .
the company said that it expect the result compared to the previous year because of cost-cutting , higher revenue and because of the growth in online trading will increase .
chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides `` solid earnings given the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , into account . ''
the plans for the holiday-employment was a day later than those of rival UPS announced the plans to 90,000 to 95,000 more workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2,42 per share , just behind the $ 2.44 per share , the predicted twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .
revenues rose by 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12,23 billion .
FedEx has in recent years , a decline in international priority shipping , the sales in its express delivery unit to stagnate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted the results at FedEx Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent to ground transportation , but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages , and self-insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result due to higher labor costs in the freight business fell .
in Premarket trading , about an hour before the opening , the FedEx shares fell to $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150,15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at their most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table , to decide whether it is time , for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate .
loom over them at one end of the ornate , two-story meeting hall there is a mural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do .
the central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : the US employment and keep prices stable here .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision , which is too close to predict , it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start , from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 to be weaned .
although most of the economic data show that it is solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rate for Bunds to increase - if only by a quarter of a percentage point .
`` Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they '' observe , Lindsey M. Piegza , Chefökonomin at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co. , said
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty is to wait around the global market enough justification to continue , '' she said .
there is no consensus on what the Fed will do what insecure themselves in the financial market .
about half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg , have forecast a rate hike this week .
the financial markets expect a wait of the Fed , with a key indicator , showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates , unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points , or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed 's policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates at this time would be , `` he said .
if it does , `` they would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets , so that they do not end up in panic . ''
other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even a month ago , the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States .
Yellen had in the spring and early summer said that this year , despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the rate expected .
although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years , and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation is below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices .
`` The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market , '' Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said .
but the financial markets around the world together zuckten late last month , after China had devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its all-time high , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now down by almost 10 % lower than in May .
the Fed representatives influence the market turbulence , the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
`` If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks had not occurred , they would attract the reins in this session , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , '' said Oliner .
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the Fed , so technically they should not be involved in their decision-making .
but in the end , the Fed has become monetary authority in the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years .
the mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed 's monetary expansion could `` narrow '' triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , representatives from the Fed can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts advise to get a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision-making is `` more art than science , '' Zachary Kara Bell , head of global strategy , said the asset management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA. , said this month that `` the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is campaigning for a rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings `` despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States , '' Lacker said .
a year later , the Fed representatives made these cuts .
the Fed should only include aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place , Adam S. Posen , a former member of the committee , said the interest rate set by the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil does not come close to this level , he said .
`` You will certainly not get into a situation where they fear a rise in interest rates , because the markets '' are concerned , Poznan , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that they should jump ahead of time .

Brazil 's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
the Brazilian Pediatric organisation SPRs is trying , in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding , it does so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements will be pregnant women and young mothers , their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day .
but new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that should make mothers .
a recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and it protects against the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern Rieder sports
the council approved the Bern Ried Bauantrag for 2.3 million expensive gym .
and he made an exception .
the roof for the solar system may be flat .
plans for the long-awaited turn buildings at the Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step : in a recent City Council meeting , the finalised Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion .
previously , the board had decided , among other things , a request for a project `` exception '' or `` liberation '' from the current construction plan .
in the `` exception '' was about the permission for a special form of roof construction .
so should a saddle roof with non-concentric First and roof over state `` will be built .
background of the planned use of the roof space for solar panels : `` We get together a wonderfully great southern roof , '' Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting .
in the `` liberation , '' it went to the roof , which will be mandatory for energy reasons - other than the construction plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall will be considerably reduced .
therefore , a `` liberation '' was necessary because the development plan allows for the roof no `` exceptions '' - whereby the Bern Rieder council usually proceeds with exemption applications rather restrictive .
the physical structures , however , this is not a recurring project : `` We are creating a precedent , '' said Steinberger .
the buildings at the centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Ried Bern .
cost of around EUR 2.3 million are factored in .
grants are expected from the school and sports promotion .
the next procedural step 18 x 36 metres wide hall Bauantrag for now will be presented to the local Health Authority for consideration .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense .
as more and more refugees are looking for an affordable home .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the battles on the German housing market have started a long time ago .
with the incoming refugees and job-seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many cities .
they compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020 .
the result of a study commissioned by the associations alliance `` social housing . ''
by comparison , this year , 260,000 units in Germany .
that 140,000 homes .
refugees are required after the first three months of their stay , not to live as asylum seekers in a reception .
many are on the housing market and a fall in the long queues in front of the apartments .
German Federal Statistical Office states , fewer than half of all asylum-seekers lived in the last year , however , for rent .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study is also significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years .
Germany told a housing deficit , which is growing from year to year .
currently around lacked full units already in the conurbations , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
that is why many professionals lived in large cities are forced into WG-rooms .
young adults were due to the slowdown in the housing market no longer involuntarily in the `` Hotel Mama . ''
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has fallen in recent years , for the first time .
to solve the problem , the alliance `` social housing '' proposes a fresh start .
the new incentives to boost social housing again .
it could be renounced the purchase tax and property taxes for subsidised housing will be temporarily suspended .
in addition , an attractive tax write-off options are needed , according to the alliance .
the support programme for refugee housing , the state bank KfW is now in towns and cities .
a week after the launch , more than half of the available was around 300 million euros on Monday evening with 184 million euros have already been retrieved .
now , the project could even be increased .
refugees freedom fighters : Croatia and Slovenia have a direct corridor
after Hungary is practically no longer get through , as more and more refugees choose the path through Croatia .
Zagreb announced to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , '' said the Croatian interior minister Ranko what .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
the EU country , Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia , from there to Western Europe .
500 people were coming over the border in Tovarnik , the Croatian television station RTL reported .
Hungary has sealed off its border to refugees on the previous day .
new laws that came into force on the same day , also obviate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said : `` You can travel , and we are preparing for that possibility . ''
these people are here , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however , there were people who wanted to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had in the morning , the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia .
according to media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of Sid .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk on the green border with Croatia .
on the Croatian-Serbian border , the refugees are not on border fences .
the border strip carries other risks : there are still active mines in the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
minesweepers are now quickly create a safe passage .
little more refugees come to Hungary , however , after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 366 people apprehended .
just before close of play on Monday , there were still water .
the new Hungarian laws consider overcoming and damage to the border fence as a criminal offence .
in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to prison sentences of up to five years and the threat of expulsion from the country .
according to the immigration authority we have received on Tuesday in the newly established on the border `` transit zones '' a total of 94 applications , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition Röszke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees had stopped .
however , virtually no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
the Hungarian view Serbia is a `` safe third country . ''
the rejected asylum-seekers are to be deported .
before the `` transit zone '' in Röszke gathered a few hundred refugees .
in Röszke workers started cleaning up .
they collected the trash , the tens of thousands of people had left in recent weeks by the roadside .
Sperrgitter were reduced and one of the camps in the border town was rebuilt .
the goal of this conversion , no one wanted to speak .
Austria reach after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
about 20,000 migrants were after government data but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people waiting for the journey to Germany .
the trains from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of the German authorities .
in Freilassing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
`` Entirety , the mayor drove across the border ''
`` We were working on the bridge festival on Sunday with the clean-up , when ten people were suddenly with suitcases at the entrance to the tent , '' says Alois Wernsteins Mayor Stadler .
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passau .
because Germany had stopped on Sunday but because of the influx of refugees , the rail transport in Austria , it was in Scuol Fans for closure , `` said Stadler , who immediately offered his help and the stranded , along with two other volunteers and their cars across the border into near Passau .
we have previously said the windfall once guests , with snack and drinks .
as we have said , we bring them by car to Passau .
`` It was , of course , for us , '' said Stadler in golden-conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man took every opportunity to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade .
`` It has been very happy , '' says Stadler .
the stranded train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels by ICE in a regional train in the direction of Passau , which took place shortly after the announcement that the rail traffic was stopped in Germany , still trying to cross the border .
but the engine was parked in front of the border in Scuol in the Inn .
Scuol in the Cross-border is generally held in high regard .
the bridge is connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before the two bridges - organized by the Union of Scuol and Bavaria .
now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us , is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
instead of helping in the camp at Röszke on the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism .
victim of this policy not only those Austrians , who are now faced with chaos in the border areas .
the countryside will have to conclude that the `` promised land '' that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and of winter to make us humane conditions for asylum seekers .
and it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter solid quarters
Konrad has with the refugee accommodation in the west .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word carries weight .
the government has the former powerful Raiffeisen-bankers used to draw up lists of the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the reception centre , where churches Konrad has already .
`` We have no more homeless in training churches , he reported to his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , without much fuss , Konrad said , and praised the organizational `` masterpiece . ''
the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a `` crisis situation . ''
a total of Konrad expects demand of 85,000 quarters this year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 homes in the next few weeks , have yet to be found - the countries are to provide 20,000 , 15,000 of the covenant .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
`` But it is not a bottomless pit , '' Konrad said .
with the country captains he has already held talks .
they had promised him to create even more refugees in the coming quarters .
in Upper Austria , it is going well , `` Ferry said Maier .
the former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , it should be clarified how the church will help .
great expectations the asylum coordinator in the ORF-action `` as we help . ''
on the platform , individuals can offer simple accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped to hotels that are empty during the winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as `` very high . ''
in times of need , it could not be that travel service provider must comply with a certain amount of towel rail or size of the skylights .
for a limited time `` emergency '' ARDS need apply .
the fact that he , in contrast to the Home Office in the placement of successful , Konrad based on his experience .
I am an older gentleman , which they say is not easily face the untruth .
persuasion is his main weapon .
Konrad Maier and cause the Republic no cost , as they themselves said .
they want to increase their number of employees at three or four .
own the search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the moment , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since it could accommodate people currently without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
for the emergency but other sites should be assessed for their suitability .
criticism of the city boss exerts on the distribution of refugees within the country .
other districts must play their part here .
Seehofer said : `` Borders are not sealed off ''
in a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer ( VP ) dint on Monday further action on the refugee issue .
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders not be sealed off .
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now doing precisely the appropriate controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being , there will be no more .
the protection would be brought , however , with regular trains to Germany .
of the other EU member states Pühringer once again called for more solidarity in the refugee issue .
now that Austria introduces controls at its borders again , for Pühringer is `` a logical consequence '' of the actions of the Germans .
the next Runtastic is a matter of time
the major overhaul of the `` New '' shipyard in Linz industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building is the Stock Exchange listed IT group S & T , the rest ( 2,700 square meters ) of young , innovative companies in the technology sector are rented .
`` In the IT are the wise heads our raw material - and we have to try to make it work for us , '' says S & T CEO Hannes Lower Hauser .
he could imagine , in start-up companies to invest in the new shipyard and later what to acquire .
from the outset , S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which houses down some promises : `` The next Runtastic is only a matter of time . ''
1.7 million euros were invested in S & T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center , which is one-third of the city of Linz , the Province of Upper Austria and the Federal ( FFG clubs ) .
the building is leased by the Linz AG for 60 years of S & T and Tech Center .
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent , there are questions .
LIA-Peroni-owner opened a second shop in the arcade

the Furla shop in front of the shop , which , among other things , bags , suitcases , shoes and garments from different manufacturers sold , everything now revolves around the brand Furla ladies handbags , wallets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday , the new shop is in operation .
several weeks earlier , was rebuilt .
`` I thought for a long time , however , whether I should just open a shop , '' Breit said .
the key to the decision was the fact that the Furla-producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a separate site on which only their handbags are sold , were done .
`` We are the only ones in the region Linz , who sell this brand , the mother of two daughters , who has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has broad by her mother in the face .
if something moves me and I can show new trends at affordable prices , is the most .
why do so many woman gets at the sight of a beautiful handbag in rapture , even the experts can answer with more certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit .
the Brulljesmacher starting from
the Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called a show-off .
this property combines some of the billionaire , who wants to be US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for Aufreger .
whether he is xenophobic , male journalists regard or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency falling sharply on the campaign .
it and doing well .
it is also registered in starting in 2008 , where the grandparents of Immobilienmilliardärs Conservator .
the New Yorker with the hair dryer is many in the village in the early 1960s .
some in the 1200-residents-site is used on dozens of corners with him .
his grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
the Kallstädterin Simone spiral shot a film about Trump .
and what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think that this is somehow exciting , but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply , '' says Simone spiral .
the native Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts shot , including Trump , the Heinz ketchup family .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , comes in `` Kings of starting '' ( 2014 ) , so to speak - by saying that he would be successful if he would live in starting .
the king of hearts , he has put it there .
while there is respect for the power of the family , but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is `` a bit of a big mouth , '' Wendel said .
as it happens , but the nickname that was starting in the vicinity , `` The Brulljesmacher '' - too high : the show-off , she says .
so Trump comes from the village of a show-off .
the Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the grandfather immigrated to the United States and opened a restaurant for gold mining .
the cornerstone of the real estate company first land purchases in New York .
but the lives of grandparents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland , the Bavarian state to which it belonged .
he took Trump because he is hewn down once without permission , the director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore , Roland Paul , had declared the movie launch .
Trump was the grandson of an `` illegal immigrant . ''
this is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
`` As the poltert , is not so appealing , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant cousin Trump ( `` The grandmother was a born Trump , Grandpa was born Heinz '' ) .
the retired sees the Americans rather aloof , `` he is always so quick-tempered . ''
does he believe that Trump is ?
`` I do n't think it can , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He has never cared about much . ''
the boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm Kallstadter as some mentioned that a descendant of the family donated Heinz during a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
`` I can not imagine the Donald , '' says the 68-year-old .
do you think it would be better if the election if he does not , because `` has such radical views , I do not know whether that is a good thing . ''
if those who were at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots , it would have been like him , `` he would never even got there . ''
`` There are '' more interesting topics than him , vintner 's daughter Sarah Bühler says .
and as President ?
`` My president is '' it is not , she says .
and : `` The grapes are ripe , even without the President Trump . ''
Wendels film , was interviewed for the Trump for a long time , have seen 12 000 moviegoers , even in the US , the interest awakened .

there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus , who want a state of their own .

for slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes , according to a new study may take at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data takes a long time to get something to show , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery , an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery .
weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods in order to reduce the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absorb food .
over the years , have obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out by people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal is between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
for the new study , researchers used from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007 , they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery , gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study .
meanwhile , the BMI was among those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal at 29 .
among those who have undergone surgery , with 36 % of the total diabetes disease and at 28 % .
in the medically-treated group disintegrated completely diabetes compared to only one percent , with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the control of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol `` generally better in the 'surgical ' group , '' the authors found .
the researchers also monitored the patient 's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c , blood sugar levels over time .
hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the surgery , the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , remained stable at around 8 % .
but this better `` glycemic control '' - as in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reflect reduced the mortality rate in five years , so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved greater reductions in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( million vs. 16.7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival advantage for surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study was in obese people who are subjected to an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years of dying - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study no advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed , Blackstone said , it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take seriously weight , once the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think that we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that a reversal `` as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is hard , really hard .

`` It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe '' - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe can not take in all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called the violence in the home countries of the refugees to end .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for through in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he claimed that the interests of humanity under the circumstances should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of the Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admirable , but the situation is not appropriate .
`` It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , '' he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts to deal with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` To care for several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long-term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , '' he said .
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
`` The use of force has never solved these problems , '' he added .
the Dalai Lama has addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush 's actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September , it became clear that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
after September 11 , I have expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence .
`` I know that his motives were good , but he used violence , and this has led to unexpected consequences , '' said the Dalai Lama .
four times the increase in use of hand disinfectant by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 , the strong alcoholic hand disinfectant swallow , the Georgia Poison Center .

he said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant , while some do it to impress their friends or because of an Estonian in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers disinfectant drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to be mixed with disinfectant mouthwash containing alcohol to get a hard drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive aromas of disinfectant .
`` A child does not think that this is bad for it is , '' Lopez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand-disinfectant ) are the ones who are perfumed .
it disinfectants with textures , its orange scent , the children are very appealing .
hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in infants just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is '' highly concentrated alcohol , Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas , the broadcaster told Fox 4 in Kansa City .
so , you would be standing around a sip of whisky , but people make these hand-disinfectant within reach of children , and if children are involved , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splash of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , two times higher than the threshold for an adult is considered legally drunk , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency room doctor and , in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
Nhaijah lallte their words and was not able to go , when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children 's hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had alienated , Ritchey said .
`` It was very scary , Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , CNN said .
it would be fatal for my child .
Lopez has encouraged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants should be stored out of the reach of children .
about alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectant , which contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol , which has been listed as an ingredient .
in January , three of the planned fourth grade students in the state of New York to poison their `` nasty '' teacher by misconstrued antibacterial products around the classroom , `` it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from their room .
the police saw the foiled plan as `` chatter '' and disciplinary action by the school authority .

why I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I am in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929 , when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approached , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to witness executions in the United States , and there are often more applicants than places available , a macabre lottery will be held to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is selected , will observe it dispassionately .
I can do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS a friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I was not a witness and can be a journalist , so it will not be allowed me , a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she `` could have put it better , '' but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he tells me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporter is here to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the promotion of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell , a reporter for the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts , which I have done .
I will not go back on all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I am going to see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters to whom you can turn to it .
what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moody claimed that stewards attempted to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately .
he appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race-day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , as the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris was that he could not explain .
he had 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to look like `` high-hanging grapes . ''
`` I was going to say nothing about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , Moody said .
you know that it went further .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I 'll go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk with my head held high , and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them .
if they start to think , I am not doing that , then I should no longer be coach .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moody 's had the bomb in an interview with racing.com high let go that the Integritäts department tried to spy on his stall .
`` Eighteen months ago , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man , whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables , in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables , '' Moody said on Racing .
you seem to believe that I am a cheater .
if that is the case , surely they should be on their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President of RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of RVL , were aware of at the time and it still is today .
this should bring me to the view that it will personally ?
the RVL Hat behave cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people out there thinking that I am there .
maybe they have to give me my license and I run , and I have no doubt that what I say , think about it .
but I am now at the point where it is no matter to me , and that makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the levels of the trainer is to have the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari , and the late scratching meant that he said that he was `` his license could throw on the table . ''
Moody , best known for its preparation of the master 's unbeaten Black Caviar , described the race-day treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied , which was against the rules .
`` It is against the rules of racing .
I have to take the full responsibility for it , `` he said .
`` One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
so it would have been last night .
it would have been all day yesterday , which was the case .
but it was also so on race day .
Moody with a three-month disqualification for the treatment to be confronted with the pack on race day , and opened an investigation into this matter .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need rules , but here they have gone too far , '' said Moody .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy 's beats against rivals because of allegations to ring fight back
the Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tack Ling his players as `` agenda setting '' of two Premier League favourites in the NRL .
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees the Storm players `` wrestling '' with his team during the Storm 's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team 's victory in the final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had made . he called the game a `` poster child '' for rugby league and said that the two Queensland is not `` too good '' in the struggle .
the Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack-on their `` Contact . ''
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainer on his team confident with him , because it means that they were worried that the Storm team to be beaten .
`` It comes up time and time again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling than they have beaten us 24 : 2 , '' Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or the techniques , but we have made over the last six weeks our contact in football makes a real focus , and this has provided us with the turnaround .
Trent is now there for three years , and he has obviously losing to a great team , so he is probably not used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it 's funny how it always comes up at this time of year .
Bellamy Bennett 's idea has attacked the `` exciting football '' and his mentor recalled that Bennett 's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` long '' because of football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night game and how exciting it was , `` Bellamy said .
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his type of football - not every team two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt has , so that they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they have probably not thought of us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys .
the game of the Broncos was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game 20 : 18 , it was two more attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
make or breaks are no points and exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
if they say to us , it means that we will be taking in a period still on it .
the Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale . the ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning .

JVA Berlin-Tegel : five square metre cell are degrading
the Federal Constitutional Court has an ex-prisoner which role he can fairly given that for months in a small cell was housed .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation , if they are housed in small cells .
the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope to get money , if they were locked up for a few days in tight spaces ( Az . : 1 BVR 1127 / 14 ) .
it was an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was in the prison hospital Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space housed ; the toilet was not spatially separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer now been released , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his liability lawsuit because of the substandard conditions of detention against the country failed in Berlin .
but the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the Court of Berlin and had the case back for further examination .
you can see the dignity of the man .
now the supreme court decides on the amount of compensation
even if only for a few days in prison days are compensation for legal reasons from the period in question was relevant , given a compensation claim , it said .
otherwise , its decline is a legal protection of personality `` would be to fear . ''
the Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation .
the constitutional judges have strengthened in the past often the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell .
degrading the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is , according to a decision by 2011 .
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday , the German Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , a decent accommodation .
the plaintiff was placed on three months between 15 to 21 hours in the same type of cell , such as in the case of Karlsruhe .
the Berlin prisons had come in recent weeks due to a lack of personnel in the headlines .
prisoners are locked up for 23 hours , again and again , the increasing aggressiveness , even with beatings , it should be because of the tense situation .
according to the press office of Justice 21 posts in Tegel are not due to defect , 19 , 2016 will be lost .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We create the ''
the influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
what lies ahead for Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany , according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination , given the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : we can do this , and we do it . ''
what is in store for Germany , conveys the following overview .
used to be , according to various estimates between 350000 ( estimate ) and the German Federal Ministry of 400,000 ( estimate of Pestel Institut ) homes a year - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as previously ( 250000 homes will be built .
dramatically , however , is the lack of housing , especially affordable rental properties : 60000-80000 per year falling out social housing from the rental price , and the affordable housing will apply as refugees .
federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) intends to double the funding , currently 518 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute : 80 000 social housing should occur annually , and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year .
agree scientists and federal minister of construction is that it must also give more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the countryside can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications , in order to help them start , criticised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees is crucial , however , whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also the self-esteem of immigrants , migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says .
in Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political shift : the work ban for refugees on the recognition of work .
while there was once a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in the view of society - is also due to the shortage of - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed for faster access to the labour market .
a big hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German .
so far , there is still no sufficient supply of general and work-related language courses .
moreover , studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts .
the development of networks is , therefore , in the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to integration .
the Berlin school administration has noted that few parents from giving their children in day-care centres , there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent , `` for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilya Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
however , in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita , managing leaflet distributed in different languages .
the demand for teachers is rising due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example , by not allowing multiple schools .
in countries without knowledge of German pupils in classes to be prepared for the classroom .
but they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers who have a qualification in English as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Beate Stoffers says of the Berlin school administration .
the Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception Berlin interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has so far but now has abandoned its stance .
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university .
as refugees with a stay of reimbursements or receive no benefits under the current law more asylum seekers when they begin their studies .
the latter have basically no Bafög , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to trainees .
refugees waited until now had to have lived in Germany for four years , in order to be Bafög-entitled , from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months .
this funding gap needs to be closed , Steffen crash , Berlin 's Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studentenwerk .
the students should immediately get Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
Islam , the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state-church law to a new state-religions-relationship develop .
also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association , the professional cares for the newcomers .
to the rights and obligations .
the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control .
this includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Ayman Mazyek , said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany have , `` for her right now , here , in Germany , forfeited , he said in the Bavarian Radio .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration in the future will be much more so than today , be a matter of the whole society .
the majority of society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has , as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade , an anti-discrimination and a general equality law .
but it is very slow , as the spirits-murder series showed that the police and authorities are systematically ignored the racist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and which require international agreements such as the anti-racism convention , must become a reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to exploit their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany was able to provide the expected refugees medically , doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says .
`` As far as a power and capacity , we create that , '' he told the Tagesspiegel .
however , this extra money to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery wants to distribute to all arrivals when registering for health cards .
services could be charged later with the Länder .
and in the long term , it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with limited services , the law stipulated that asylum seekers performance .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers .
until now , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , in doctors `` offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted , she says .
many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances .
and with a different diagnostic .
among refugee children , for example , there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and young people go for HIV awareness .
with some of the other diseases German doctors would come from their training , but clearly , Montgomery says .
`` Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to discern . '' And as far as the shortage of doctors , even through the refugees might be relief in sight .
the Syrians have a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practise , but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany , according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists ( BPtK ) mentally ill , most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , said Dietrich Munz , President of BPtK .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness , dizziness , palpitation and Todesängsten .
other symptoms of sleep and concentration , strong shock and emotional numbness .
in order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , early treatment needed , Munz said .
so far , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
while mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services can make a request for psychotherapy , but the process usually takes several months .
in addition , officers or doctors who are trained for mental illness would not usually in the social services , decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
this often leads to miscalculations , Munz said .
Manege invites you to dream

Wang Lin from China is the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with its agility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
`` The animals are part of our family , '' Stephanie 's mother , Brigitte Probst said .
abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Stephanie Probst also notes : `` It is not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . ''
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any pranks canvas .
the `` four-legged artists , '' as they are called , can be read as possible .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
the animal is not feeling well , it is not in the circus ring .
so the top priority : good care for the animals .
especially on their Zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare , the Probst family is proud .
the two animals have lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened .
`` But then , all of a sudden , our little Jumbo , was there , '' says Brigitte Probst .
the Zebroid is still not ready for the circus ring , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst .
so something for every visitor should be there .

the Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack must be Goal.com
Wenger told Goal.com stressed that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he ca n't play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Goal.com will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history , his participation in next summer 's European Championship will still uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that the Goal.com had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then was back to his old swing found during the early season .
this kind of `` threat of injury is not the career , '' Wenger said .
it is a bone that has not healed well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked to his ankles , or with the injury he had before .
that may be true from a purely medical point of view , but also , as Wenger acknowledged , there is the risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also developed an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases from Goal.com recorded since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have had the most injuries .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain power struggle , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the sort that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday , and Wenger is a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a little breather , '' Wenger said .
although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe .
Dynamo is unrivalled , even after 41 games after the `` invincible '' campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal , the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope , with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' Wenger said .
it has never worked at Arsenal .
in 2006 , we were very close , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .
friends : the comedy show that serious lessons about male friendships granted
the lack of similar images in the show is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever , as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than in women .
in a bid to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to challenge the culture in question , the men to seek help when they need it .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy '' mood , had doubled his chances of recovery are .
for those who are not depressed , cut a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , you have to have friends , a friendship can work .
in the age of social media-led communications , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives are lively , strong , and to be successful , doubled , even if , in fact , dominated the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , reputation , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health is much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money really ca n't buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down .
each character has been defined by his work , but because of his personality , which was notable for the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs , moments when football peering into comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross , Rachel , all of which came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings .
as an employee of the telecommunications ministry told me : ... `` my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
the men who contact us , often feel unable to talk with friends .
the old saying `` I get it '' has a huge impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about issues openly. ``
friends of one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms .
you clearly presents the small moments of male friendships .
so my objective outsider status over the phone to people in moments of despair , may also contribute to the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend , Comedy Central friends decided to celebrate the day with the completely redesigned backdrop , why do n't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk .
or , even better , if you are sitting around in Starbucks alone someone see you give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .

but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal , and he was later in the game against his hometown team , and against the club with which he began his illustrious career began back in 1999 , changed .
`` It is not easy to win at home and away in the Champions League , so it is a good place to start looking back , 2 : 0 to win , and to cause problems for our opponents , even if there are certain things that '' over the course of the season , we still need to improve , `` Blanc said .
`` This is a good omen .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals. ``

if anyone believed , however , that PSG would achieve a great victory , was disappointed .
Malmö , Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage , joined by National Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield lined up a serious opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed away at Kevin Music post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PSG gave themselves sometimes , with some bad passes and poor qualifications , not least from Inter , patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from Inter , Di Maria turned in a low shot which by Wiland in the 52nd minute was turned past the post ...
the second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani . the Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter left flank of Maxwell had been exploited .
that ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into play , and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz was the end result , keep low , before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , was later that PSG was a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : `` Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough. ``
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game from them !

Rome now has a Martin-Luther-
nearly 500 years after the Reformation in Rome , there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz .
in the presence of mayor Ignazio Marino on Wednesday was a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio Hill on behalf of the German reformer .
on the `` Piazza Martin Lutero , '' he is now recognised as a `` German theologian of the Reformation . ''
the park is located in the ancient Rome , right next to the Colosseum .
the name had been requested by the Association of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , pastor of the Lutheran church hymns in Rome , recalled Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over the centuries as a minority often only able to live their faith in secret .
the space will be visible in a symbolic way , that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) was as a young Augustinian monk around the New Year 1510 / 11 some months in Rome .

hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns ( gold ) is one of the main works , Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus old post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not in the Otmar-Alt-Bible , now with splendid images appeared .
in the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has put in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his `` language '' with bright colors and fanciful shapes , the 75-year-old - but what is not synonymous with `` funny '' pictures .
on the contrary , in line with the relevant issues , which may seem pretty bleak .
roughly three years , Otmar Alt worked on his Bible Project , for which he has a subjective artistic choice from the many areas of the `` Book of Books '' .
born cycles that address issues such as crossroads , plagues , bids or Our Father .
so has he spontaneously several partners fascinated : this applies to the Luther-publisher with his theological orientation , as well as for the Kettler-Verlag , with its focus on art books .
and since the author Klaus old post office , who has worked on the basis of the painting with the relevant biblical passages is especially .
he has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt , and so to the present day , in the current context `` translated . ''
these texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , his own personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewellery cover has golden letters .
this allows the 75-year-old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were the trigger for the Bible Project : Otmar Alt , 1940 in Wernigerode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine-Order .
`` As the education was '' already with the cane , Otmar Alt remembers .
`` I tried to come to terms with it , to stand by me , perhaps with the father . ''
his second concern was to help the arts in faster time to value : `` The perception of visual worlds today is dominated by advertising , and it is loud .
symbolism is out there .
artists have a different pleasure and joy to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur .
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images `` fall '' are allowed to work , discover and feel the power they have : `` The picture is looking for his counterpart . ''
Klaus post confessed on Tuesday during the presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible-in-Otmar Alt-Foundation , `` has always been a lover of Otmar Alts art was to be : '' I like how he sees life with his images. ``
old did not care to fully understand the Bible , but the key for him , even mysterious issues .
`` This was no cooperation on an equal footing , '' the post says : `` This is about the images , the text merely explained . '' It was a Bible .
for Hans Möhler from Luther-publishing this book is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler ( biblical ) both the language of love and responsibility .
part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , on 15 November in the Otmar Alt-Foundation will be opened .

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures-shop of horrors : the designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) , on Wednesday in Munich presented an exhibition of his work .
the highlights : mannequins that look thanks to video projections frighteningly human .
you have the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was , among other things , with Madonna 's stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts .
`` I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture , because I have white hair . ''
`` In the past it was bleached , it is '' real , `` Gaultier said .
for visitors to the exhibition `` From The centre To The Catwalk '' ( From the sidewalk to the catwalk ) , on 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer 's initial opposition to a show about his person has changed .
in fact , he had been against the idea , because : `` An exhibition for me sounded a bit after death , '' he said .
when one dies , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had made previously in Montreal , Canada and in Paris .
`` It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger more Diedrich said .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard of work of the man who has made fashion history without ever training .
the show is arranged chronologically , but it is an excellent choreographiertes total work of art , which was used in a lot of effort , in order to fudge the dolls , for example , has hired a stylist .
the 14 tons of material , according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot gekarrt after Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special highlight : a leather pants-outfit with a corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he was always interested in strong women ( `` women are smarter than men '' ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
even horse animal old Teddy is on display in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tentative steps of designer fashion .
as a child ( he was not a good student and ) bad in football , he was attracted to his teddy bras and dresses , Gaultier said .
playing with a doll , his parents would not allow him .
the design of fashion he had taught himself later .
he stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers looked at how Gaultier said in Munich .
later , I bought the then but of course .
for his first fashion show he did not pay for the models .
you got nothing , but the clothes were allowed to keep .
jewelry will net curtain - `` top as a fashion niche
previously , it was the long embroidery machines in Plauen to make yards .
the embroidered fabrics and lace in large quantities for customers who , for example , processed them with blankets and curtains .
that alone no longer works , Andreas Reinhardt , CEO of fashion tip Plauen explains .
instead , the fashion is important .
in the early days of the `` top fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now being rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt cites some examples : lead in jewellery , accessories such as handbags and in regional costumes .
put all the so-called vintage fashion , which in past eras , a growing job potential .
anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche that is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
fashion tip Plauen is a member , along with nine other companies in the industry association `` lace and embroidery .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are there .
private shops and wholesale , there is almost no more .
our products reach the customers in this way .
today 's mass-produced goods will be cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively on chains .
in addition , the export schwächle , after Russia and the United States .
so plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer said of the stick pearl in Falkenstein : `` Since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable manner . ''
Reinhardt added : `` This also refers to the materials used . ''
graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow Berger of West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace .
to counter the competition from Asia , you need to find high-quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies , especially the need to think economically , `` says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic pyramid top .
the machine uses small beads in some places .
the Goldsmiths `` champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became : '' Before , I could n't deal with traditional `` top . ''
now she uses the snowball head for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region to identify with the subject '' tip - young and old , `` says Reuter .
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento .
so I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of `` tip .

EU wants to limit mercury in carnivorous fish double
the European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and consumers expect a significantly higher dose of nerves gifts .
the consumer organisation Food Watch , submitted a working paper of the European Union , sharply criticized the plans : `` The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies with full force passed on pregnant women and young children , '' said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch .
Wolf Schmidt , the limits of the nerve poison should be increased for large fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish Hai- or for `` economic reasons '' from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that approximately 50 percent of the catches should be based on the current limits have not yet sold .
after doubling the limit then only 14.5 % would be unsaleable .
in return , the EU wants to tighten this easing in food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
food Watch described it as a `` trick '' because smaller Fried fish , such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the proposed limits .
the reduction of small fish is therefore a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy alone , `` said Wolf Schmidt .
Mercury is highly toxic to humans , a heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain , especially in carnivorous fish .
therefore , the federal government warns that `` even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn . ''
the Federal Ministry for the Environment said on its website in relation to the current levels , but that a `` health risk to the general population '' is not expected .
Mercury mainly by the burning of coal in the environment .
the German coal-fired power plants to meet a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment at the Green members Anna Lena Baer wanted more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two-thirds of the total issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was `` permanently and all the '' mirror `` in March exceeded '' from the paper , was quoted as saying .
in the past year were Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF .
