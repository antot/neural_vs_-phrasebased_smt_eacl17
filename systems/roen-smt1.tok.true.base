this is what will happen when the fed will rais interest rate
interest rate will rise and the bull market ( rise market ) will stand , the bond valu will increas and the economi will go into recess .
what we know .
what we do n't know is how long it will happen and how long it will take .
in econom , histori offer few clue on time .
after the first interest rate would rise , the recess occur in just 11 month and last 86 month .
the aggress of the feder reserv rais interest rate is often , though not alway , a determin factor of how the respons to the economi and the financi asset .
therefor , the us central bank offici have grown so strong that investor should not focus on when start to rais interest rate but the trajectori over time for normalis .
inde , there are mani variabl at play .
but , in the end , the market player may find that the whole flap over interest rate rise was exagger .
`` the first interest rate increas by the fed after the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as a sign of the '' era of cheap money , `` said julian jessop , chief economist at capit econom , in a note to client .
on the contrari , we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rate to more normal level but still small to constitut the seismic shock that seem to fear anyon .
but you ca n't say that there will be no effect .
still present how could react to some sector of the economi , base on histor trend :
given the situat with which the market has face in recent month , the anticip of an interest rate rise may volatiliza thing for a while .
but , at the time , the impact is not so dramat .
`` it seem that there is a trend that the return of capit to stagnat for 12-24 month after the first rise , which reflect the can again defazajul in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi on what will happen after the fed hike .
more specif , in the past 35 year , the market has risen sharpli - about 14 percent - head for interest rate rise , quit invariabila from 250 day after ( up an averag of 2.6 % ) after which return to normal after 500 day , with an averag return over the past six cycl of 14.4 % , accord to a recent analysi publish on barron 's chief strategist at nuveen asset manag .
deutsch said the impact on action tend to becom more pronounc later in the cycl of rise interest rate and the benefit are start to declin .
the recess is a fact of econom life , but rise interest rate often contribut to this .
in the current situat , the fed face some condit that have not exist befor and that could acceler a recess .
more specif , the gross domest product will be closer to it histor low point for a fed interest rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , the 118 interest rate increas sinc the 1950s , onli twice the nomin gdp was less than 4.5 % .
even though in the second quarter of 2015 valu was 3.6 per cent , few expect the situat to persist , the third quarter rose onli 1.5 % , accord to the atlanta fed .
rise interest rate in an economi so fragil could be riski and could rais the question `` if this time is differ , '' said deutsch .
market player have prepar all year for a decis from the fed , all eye were on to this week 's meet of the feder open market committe , which end on thursday .
although mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv an increas in the interest rate on the occas of this meet , the futur trade indic a probabl of onli 25 % .
`` in our studi , conduct after 1950 , all of the interest rate hike cycl so far have been in a super cycl of increas profit , gdp dwarf pre-recess peak veri quick after the start of the recoveri , '' the report said .
on the contrari , it was a strang slow recoveri after the worst recess in the period under review .
the current cycl is by far the longest expect by the fed at the end of the last recess ; the record was 35 month , and he has reach 74 month and continu .
fix incom has also been volatil as the market anticip an increas in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividend .
the main differ is that the impact is more quick in the case of bond than stock when the fed polici chang .
in the case of bond , it seem that the benefit of chang direct as soon as the first increas / decreas in the cycl .
at the end of the cycl of rise interest rate , bond profit declin immedi , `` said deutsch .
charl schwab strategi i believ that these rate increas will determin near profit between short-term bond and long-term one , aplatizand curv .
the bond with high profit is fare better in such an environ , although `` we are still cautious about forc profit , '' said in an analysi of kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab .
interest , jone believ that the market have alreadi adjust to the expect of fed polici .
`` in addit to the strength of the dollar and lower inflat estim , there are few sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of a more rigor monetari polici , '' wrote jone .
short-term interest rate have risen , the cost curv is more right , spread the averag rate of interest credit has expand and increas volatil - all the characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad , compani oper in the us will benefit from the rise interest rate and local product will becom more attract .
the multin with larg debt will suffer becaus the dollar will lead to higher price for their product in the global market and their debt will be more expens .
`` histori show that the '' qualiti `` stock tend to be more profit in the subsequ three month after an initi interest rate of growth , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report to client .
compani with strong balanc sheet have outperform those with a weak balanc sheet after each of the interest rate increas in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , with an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with larg receipt from capit and stock with low volatil have also outperform similar compani with a lower qualiti , with an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) , or 3 ( percentag point ) .
the debt will becom an import issu .
compani with a larg percentag of debt flotanta have the most to lose , say goldman .
consum will also benefit from the rise dollar .
those save could also benefit , although expert do not agre on how quick this will happen .

similar subject : adam lyth has left the england team for the test match and was replac by alex hale
obvious , as his coach of yorkshir , i find it difficult to look at the decis not to select him on adam lyth in the team .
he play seven test match against two good striker , in difficult condit , and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket player are judg by result .
there were no question mark about joe root , for exampl , until the ad have been made sinc - and i have said it befor - the player are their own selectioneri .
some fifti year and perhap lyth and would have extend the run but his fate is in his hand .
i hope that if you do more run workshop for yorkshir will have other opportun .
head coach of england , bayliss , prais the attitud even when the perform was not commensur with his abil and i am not surpris by this ; abov all , he is a man of the team .
it is hard to answer the question of how long is notic a batsman in test match .
lyth had seven-run - and sam robson ahead to - while nick compton had nine .
onli compton had luck at home and away .
the onli complaint you can have was that england had prefer jonathan trott in the caribbean tour - when lyth was in top form - but the miss opportun is a thing of the past .
the team come alex hale , a batsman whom cotez veri well .
it is a cricket player who has the `` x factor '' and i notic earli in yorkshir this season when he score 236 against us at trent bridg pitch .
should be given at least the same opportun as those befor it , but this will of cours depend on the composit of the team in the uae .
the idea that moeen was launch to open at the neck with cook , which could lead to extrajudici spinner while preserv the four quick , and i have noth against it .

peopl may judg his young age - with an averag of 31 to 35 and fire the ball - and believ it could punt , but there is not a lot of selectionerii spinneri and opt for youth .
will learn a lot from this tournament .
england has made some chang in the team of coach .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lankan batsman , as consult for test match could be a blow to the master .
it is one of the best player and will bring a lot of experi , given that he play in everi situat and against all type of attack .

a european diplomat explain that the last few day - sunk in similar crise in the eu - not all of them caus intern - some member state are power by britain 's agenda of concess and chang to the treati , which most do not want .

my friend , who want a great britain with outward perspect under the roof of the eu - `` we are alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that sever minist and offici obtuzi in certain capit have reach the point where they do not care if they stay or go .
angela merkel , the german chancellor extrem cautious , is an alli but has stay at the helm for 10 year and want to leav the posit befor her situat to unravel , as happen with thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) , who stay too long .

it is hard to believ that they will help the english who pose , whose energi would be better use to prevent scotland out of britain - someth we do n't want her either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
thus , some minist could be even intend to make remark that do not help , in the style of the snp in the referendum campaign in britain in 2017 to speed up the process of brexit , my amicul suggest .
`` the renegoti was fix '' and `` britain has not achiev anyth of valu in the renegoti . ''
european know on their skin as acaparatoar may be fleet street and how skeptic are the media baron who are sceptic about the eu , becaus they have not particip in the referendum in 1975 inspir by toni benn who has ratifi our entri in 1973 in 2 : 1 .

they includ the mix of pungasi neplatitori tax , foreign phone fraudau and pseudo-domi who hold most of the major newspap .
in fact , toni blair will see about as though he realis that when you re lock in a doghous with a gorila skittish , we need to give them banana to distract from the thought of you eat at lunch and again at tea .
in fact , miliband was more blairit than blair in opposit to the idea of cameron 's referendum , given that blair made a concess on the principl of the eu constitut abandon , buri by french and dutch voter in 2005 , which gave him an exit card .
the media has not forgiven for that .
but jeremi corbyn , who was a friend , hit back on monday at westminst - i told him not to consum his time with me - seem to be in danger from egg to adopt the strategi to boycott murdoch of neil kinnock in the 1980s , a mistak then and now .
it can take time , but we need to develop a coher strategi for cooper with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose posit at the bbc 's holiday on sunday .
corbyn 's offici stanc toward europ is what i would call with gentl evolut .
he say he would like to stay in a reform eu .
most of those who do not agre with the `` anglicismul '' conserv could agre with that .

it remind me of the 1970s , when his father was fought on tv to be unfair labour colleagu , without go too far and without lose their posit in the cabinet .
hilari 's struggl was more attract .
but the fight to stay `` in ani situat '' - benn 's express - doe not correspond with what mcdonnel said nor what jc said colleagu and lawmak in a privat meet monday night .
regardless of the imag that corbyn want to convey - rememb , i was on me - the disciplin and awar messag remain import in the televis era , and especi in social network , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it is right not to be given a ticket for cameron 's favour in europ , allow her to take good support labour in the campaign for the referendum , as mcdonnel said .
simon jenkin certain believ this .
but mcdonnel 's basic sofismul and corbyin on membership of the eu - in line with their past anti-capitalist - is no longer just an esoter discuss among left-w dissid narcisismul for small differ is a central dogma .
as with his sofismului on nato - tom watson is adam about the fact that jc will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomat will be forc to tri to understand .
whi should scupper pari or berlin polit capit - and there are voter suspici - for concess to britain when everyth could be worthless ?

expert criticis the decis of the depart of public health england on electron cigarett
accord to the research , a govern agenc claim that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke result from a meet between 12 peopl , some of them with tie to the tobacco industri .
specialist from the editori team of the magazin 's british medic journal ( bmj ) join the lancet paper criticis the evid use by the depart of public health england ( phe ) in it report on electron cigarett .
phe has publish the report `` benchmark '' last month and describ him as a `` comprehens analysi of the evid . ''
some research have rais question about the robust of data and point finger at the link between some expert and the tobacco industri .
an articl publish last month in the medic magazin lancet attack the `` extraordinarili fragil basi '' on which he found phe main conclus .
two other research who write in the bmj have question the claim and their base `` on solid ground or sand miscat . ''
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
said they expect the phe claim that the `` current estim show that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke '' are base on a detail analysi of the evid and model .
in fact , one meet attend by 12 peopl led to the draft of a model of multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) to summaris their view on the negat effect associ with differ product that contain nicotinoid ; the result of this meet were shown briefli in a research paper .
mckee and his capewel said that one of the sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose execut director has said that it would be in the past receiv fund from british american tobacco to conduct an independ studi .
he also valid the accredit of bat in public health in a report on sustain , he said .
they ad that one of the 12 particip at the meet said the fund receiv from an electron cigarett manufactur but not the financ that there are report that he had receiv from the produc of cigarett and tobacco compani philip morri intern .
have not provid the argument on the basi of which were select panelului member but they includ sever `` fruntasi '' known in the product of electron cigarett , some of them even say the financ industri .
other particip in the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
the meet was also attend by the head of the tobacco control at phe .
the research group develop it whitewash `` conclus '' that the lack of `` solid evid on the detriment effect it has most product under the major of the criteria , '' said mckee and capewel .
howev , the phe report doe not mention ani of these link or limit .
mckee and capewel said phe claim that `` so far there is no evid that e-cigarett are a factor that encourag smoke among children or non-smok '' are prematur .
professor kevin fenton , director of health at phe , say it has respond in the past to the claim in the bmj .
he said : `` electron cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one of the two peopl who have smoke all her life lose his life becaus of this defect .
all the evid suggest that the risk pose by e-cigarett for health are minor in comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about the inform and those who do not stem from evid , especi given the high degre of public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
everi year , about 80,000 peopl lose their live becaus of a diseas associ with smoke and the annual cost incur by the nhs from smoke to reach 2 billion pound .
express clear current evid - name that , although the use of electron cigarett is not without it risk , it is onli a fraction of the harm effect of smoke - our nation debt .

violinist david grimal : bach 's era there were no world tour .
beethoven , brahm , bartok , enescu were peopl who work , artist and trade repres .
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artist of our time , known not onli as littl as well as the initi of a less familiar , downright `` weird , '' as he himself say , les disson - an orchestra compos of intern soloist and talent musician , who perform a repertoir simfon without a conductor , and that make it to be at least a curios in the classic music landscap .
les disson was this year at the enescu festiv with two perform : a perform on sunday , in which littl was david grimal , founder of the orchestra , and one on monday , when the spotlight was cellist xavier phillip , the compound work by enescu as nelipsit .
both perform , held on stage ateneului , show the public anoth way to interpret classic music .
les disson appear on the music scene in 2004 , at the time , the onli classic music as a whole in which there is not a conductor .
conductor is the most import musician for musician .
it is true , on the one hand the musician need an educ or to becom soloist , either to becom perform in an orchestra - speak instrumentisti , not compos .
they are train as `` specialist worker . ''
they themselv have the impress that they need a conductor .
on the other side of the scene , to the public , all music fetisizarea focus on the conductor .
and so , businessul , the music industri , is it market .
therefor , no longer talk about the music .
so , if you look at this world , we have the skill worker , which is stupid , and an audienc that ca n't listen , but we need to look at , and what is stupid , `` believ david grimal .
violinist describ this chang in the way that make the music came from the music `` disillusion '' in his career .
i was a high-level athlet who had to do the same exercis in the whole world with differ orchestra , to earn money and to bring the money and the music industri .
10 year ago , when i was around 30 year ago , i found it veri depress , becaus no longer creativ and human fratern in this system .
so , i have not found ani connect to continu on this path .
so i decid to creat les disson .
this happen in 2004 , and at the time nobodi was do it without a conductor : `` the music world , extrem conserv , did not want such project . ''
`` as you can imagin to do market with a collect of musician in which no more ego ? '' ask the artist .
david grimal admit les dissonac repres `` a luxuri , '' say that none of the musician who are part of the orchestra doe not depend on the success of this project to live .
in 10 year of exist of the ensembl , the lack of a conductor has not prove to be a hindranc in his music : `` curious , sing a more complex repertoir , so it seem easier , becaus all the musician are oblig to be present in the work and not just in the role , '' say grimal , ad that sunday 's perform was `` 74 conductor on stage . ''
in grimal 's view , the enescu festiv is `` veri courag , '' precis becaus he invit and les disson : `` an extraordinari festiv , where are the greatest orchestra in the world who sing and 3 time a day , and in the midst of these orchestra you invit and this strang group . ''
in a templ of orchestral tradit , as is the enescu festiv , there is the place and the interest for someth differ that break barrier .
speak about the work of enescu , romanian violinist admit he feel the music of the famous romanian compos , so did not need a special approach when he introduc the enescu work in his repertoir .
grimal note that enescu 's music is veri instinct , but this is what happen when we talk of georg enescu and romanian music , `` becaus there is also a georg enescu who made the french music . ''
grimal is commit to chang how it make classic music educ , believ that `` the profess of musician , as it is call today , has a flavour of death '' and that `` the futur of music is the music itself . ''
we do not need to do the round of the world 5 time a year if it doe not serv at all .
in the era of bach there were no world tour .
beethoven , brahm , bartok , enescu were peopl who work , who were artist and not trade repres .
for me , hold concert , festiv , tournament , launch albumelor , all are tremend , extraordinari , but as long as they are in the servic of music .
if not , we are in a system where creativ is suffer , no longer has freedom .
to illustr this phenomenon , david grimal gave the exampl of the romanian product befor and after access to the european union : `` in romania , befor we enter the eu , had good meat and veget . ''
in order to enter the eu had to adopt sanitari law which are not good for veget and meat .
product and agricultur are in the supermarket , as is the case in franc .
the music is the same thing , it 's the same logic .
les disson red is perhap not too nice , but when they cut the tomato are true .
in an ideal world , should this music to return to the centr and that the institut and industri that manag this system to understand that music doe n't need to be sold , but it need to be share , and this can be done from the educ polici .
`` if i believ - as do the korean , chines , japanes - that western music is one of the most beauti thing of human , we reintroduc his learn in school , we reintroduc the concert on tv and through this educ would no longer be requir to sell music by-product , '' grimal believ .
certain , there are thing in classic music educ that remain veri communist , this everywher , is someth veri militaris .
it depend on this disciplin if we compar a musician with a soldier , or if they form a musician who will play an instrument , and , abov all , the musician .
we are talk about a complet differ educ , if we want to form a soldier ( this educ - n.red . ) must be in a way , if we want to form a musician , is someth els entir .
after your parearea , what is more danger , a soldier or a musician ? `` ask the french artist smile .
grimal show that , for artist , the reward of a differ kind of music come from overcom this status of `` soldier , '' overcom what they believ are the `` limit '' : `` musician discov at some point that they are not soldier , and that is whi after the concert come out smile . ''
david grimal spoke about his music project and about his music and the artist in the `` festiv of idea , '' a discuss with the public held at the georg enescu intern festiv by the aspen institut romania .

tuesday at scazusera close 11 % on a year and 17 % from the record peak record on 11 june .
the most anticip meet in recent year , with polici maker at the feder reserv will spend two day this week around a tabl of honduran mahon with 27 feet to decid whether the time has come to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
abov their head , at one end of the hall of the central bank , will glimps a mural of the unit state .
the map is intend to recal that janet l. yellen , the fed chairman , and his colleagu have to put the econom interest of the nation abov all els .
the central bank has receiv a doubl burden from congress : to maximis the rate of employ in the us and to maintain price stabil .
but the econom crisi , the fed leader have confirm that there is a third unwritten task : financi stabil .
and this third pregnanc could be the x factor in a decis is too difficult to predict , which will be announc on tuesday , and that will determin whether the us economi is readi to be dezbarata of unpreced stimulus provid by short-term interest rate near zero in place sinc late 2008 .
even if the major of the data indic a strong growth in the economi , the recent global financi market could scare off the fed offici are alreadi wari about ad volatil by increas the benchmark feder fund rate - even with a quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious , the labour market and inflat will be the first and the main issu we will be watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais interest rate , rise uncertainti in the global market is enough to give them argument to wait , '' she said .
there is no consensus regard the decis that we will take the fed , this in itself caus instabl in the financi market .
about half of the economist poll by bloomberg recent predict a rise in interest rate this week .
but the financi market expect the fed to delay , a key indic show that the probabl of growth is onli 30 % .
this would indic a declin in the stock market if the fed rais interest rate , except where those develop polici would cushion the blow by promis that it would take a long time until the next boom .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag climb 228,89 point , or 1.4 per cent , to 16.599,85 .
the momentum was trigger by expect that the fed polici maker will keep interest rate stabl this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be surpris that the fed to rais interest rate at this time , '' lonski said .
if the fed decis maker would do this , `` should act in depth in their polici to avoid panic in financi market . ''
other expert have said that an increas in the interest rate would calm financi market becaus it would remov the uncertainti about when the fed will act .
just a month ago , the fed seem to be on track to increas the rate of 0.25 per cent this month , the first small step toward the slow tighten of monetari condit that would confirm the strength of us recoveri .
yellen said in the spring and earli summer that was expect an interest rate rise this year despit the object of liber as that would need more econom progress .
although job creation has slow in august , the labour market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest percentag in more than seven year and near the level of the fed believ that full employ of labour .
wage gain show sign of growth .
and although inflat has continu to achiev the annual goal of the central bank , fed polici maker have said that a key reason was a temporari effect of the sharp drop in oil price .
`` the economi can withstand higher rate and need them , given the tension of the labour market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but the global financi market have begun to enter fibrilatii later this month , after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag fell by 16 per cent below the record peak reach in may , as investor have fear that the slow chines economi will drag down global growth .
the market reculat somewhat this month , the dow is now about 10 % below the peak in may .
for the fed decis maker , the market is ad to the complex calcul of the time of rise interest rate .
`` without what happen in financi market and the news about the chines economi weaken in recent week , it would be the strongest in a meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a research with expertis in the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he expect to wait at least a month in order to better manag the effect .
`` there is a lot of uncertainti about what will be the impact on the us economi and almost no data on which to base subsequ event in china , '' olin said .
when the global economi is not one of the major interest of the fed , so that basic should not be taken into account in make decis .
but , in realiti , the fed has becom the monetari author in the world .
in recent year , the central bank 's influenc was huge .
simpl remind of the then chairman , ben s. bernank , in 2013 , that the fed could `` narrow '' monetari expans trigger an earthquak in global market .
in a world where market and economi are twin with more and more , it is expect that fed offici not onli to monitor progress in other area , but also to consult with other central bank and expert in order to better interpret the world economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi at wealth manag firm envestnet , inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , please. , said this month that `` the fed has a histori of bloat reaction to chang in the financi market that seem to have no connect with the econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the feder open market committe , the bodi with decision-mak role , which has support the increas in the interest rate , provid that such decis in 1998-99 .
a financi crisi that hit asia prompt the fed to cut it benchmark rate to 0.75 per cent in three meet , `` despit the possibl of identif with limit implic for the develop of the us , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici have revers their respect scaderilor .
edf should put the issu of financi stabil in the first place onli in case of a major crisi , such as the earthquak was on the market in 2008 , said adam s. posen , a former member of the interest rate set committe at the bank of england .
last turbul period not long at that level , he said .
`` certain we do n't want to get into fear of a rise in interest rate becaus the market have been upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv still hold dual mandat and doe not mention the financi stabil and , until will chang anyth in this regard , i do n't think we should take action prematur .

i can guarante that i have not chang anyth all year in our defens system or techniqu , just as much as in the last six week we have realli put emphasi on contact in placari and so i chang the situat .
trent is in offic for three year and obvious has a great team , so perhap that is not use to lose , and it was a shock to him .

but now has a team that can play what i see as thrill footbal , particular young mijlocasilor manoeuv .
this is the kind of game you want to do when you have such player .
he made this argument in 2010 , now want everyon to adopt his style of play - not everi team has two mijlocasi as anthoni milford and ben hunt to be abl to play like that .
it give me more confid becaus they say these thing becaus i am somewhat worri about the match with us .
now six week were probabl not to us when we were in big match .

the game against the bronco was probabl a good game , we have not yet seen , as was the score ? 16-12 ?
our match end 20-18 , in our game there were two attempt , that mean thrill game ?
or thrill mean to get the break and not marchezi ?
for me are the plan .
if we talk about us , it mean that at some point we could meet .
storm is free this weekend becaus they have earn the right to play at home or with north www.wfdeaf.org cowboy , with the cronulla shark in the preliminariilor final next saturday at aami park , with ticket on sale start next tuesday , in the morn .

as he close hagi contestatarilor mouth
consid by mani the greatest romanian footbal in histori , gica hagi was label , after withdraw from work , as a poor coach , which may not be abl to perform in the new posit .
after bitter experi in the nation team , the star or galatasaray , hagi took over , a year ago , the coach role at the futur of constanta , patroneaza team .
fix after a year after take over the team , he has shown that he is capabl of turn around a team that mire to save from releg in the top one .
so , after a year , the futur record , with hagi coach , 16 win , 11 remiz and 11 defeat .
the balanc sheet is one of the top team , which is knock at the european cup .
thing took a turn for the better and for the futur of this season , as the team reach second place in the leagu 1 , with 19 point , one less than the leader astra giurgiu .
futur also has the best attack in the leagu 1 , with 20 goal ( on par with the astra ) , more than doubl than the star .
on the other hand , even if he brought to the team with more experienc player , hagi has continu the polici of promot young peopl , and late in the team 's name appear as iani hagi or hodorogea .
the club 's polici has made the futur team want for team from abroad , such as hagi sold this summer by 1.5 million euro - iani hagi ( fiorentina - 1 million euro ) and alexand mitrita ( bari - 500 thousand euro ) .
with the star , the futur is the onli profit team in leagu 1 , accord to data from the trade regist .
in the refuge crisi , romania has play so far as a small countri .
it is a legitim strategi , but then you re not ask to be treat as the seventh largest countri in the eu .
the big countri come up with solut for the entir eu , say cristian ghinea , a member of the colleg and director of the romanian center for european polici .
in an interview with ziare.com , cristian ghinea show that europ can not be transform into a fortress , and the polic simpli mean they will not work in this crisi : `` perhap we have doubt about the qualiti of the valu that come with these peopl . ''
but there are mass who have start and we can not return to histori .
migrat is a realiti that we have to adapt as well and to adapt them to us .
in his opinion , cristian ghinea , we are in an extrem emot moment , in which the politician feel the need to show muscl .
after he goe , the european will not be will to give up freedom of movement , but the rule in the schengen area must be chang : `` schengen is now an anim creat in anoth era , and which was not adapt to the situat now . ''
where we are in the refuge crisi after the jha council which , in fact , has not solv anyth ?
it is clear that the ec presid in agreement with donald tusk did not want to forc a vote on the council .
the forecast for the all say that would have had the necessari vote .
befor the treati of lisbon , the jha appli the principl of unanim and ani state can block ani decis .
therefor , thing were veri littl integr in the field of justic and home affair .
after lisbon , appli to the normal procedur , in which the ec has the initi , and the council approv with a vote of 55 % of the state , or 16 , which repres 65 % of the eu popul .
calcul were say that the vote were there .
but did n't want to go forward .
becaus it is a sensit issu , there were even reject reaction in germani against the polici of open up chancellor merkel and did not want to appear in mani countri as a respons of we send eu migrant per head. ``
so were postpon , but the problem remain becaus , obvious , this creat a huge problem for schengen govern and is like to see big chang there in the come period .
so mandatori quota were not realli elimin , but the topic was onli allow to be cool ?
yes , on the other hand , there is talk about the greater involv of frontex in the manag of extern border , which mean a chang from the individu respons of member who are on the extern border of the schengen communiti respons .
greec 's border with turkey and germani 's border with turkey , de facto , and this wave of migrant given the limit of the old schengen system .
mayb they will give up the dublin principl , accord to which migrant are the respons of the state in which the first time , becaus it 's not sustain .
if greec capoteaza , you ca n't say forev that is greec 's job .
the problem is common .
precis becaus the problem is common , it is possibl to resolv without a precis mechan , perhap even mandatori , for share the effort ?
no one know exact how they will oper mandatori quota , if it will reach them .
it remain a question : what do you do with a man who doe not want to come to romania or in portug , but in sweden or germani ?
i do n't think it will clutch the european state to take up the migrant : you go in countri x or y. countri
perhap it will reach some uniqu filtrat centr , in greec or turkey , where to process asylum applic .
are work on solut like this .
but the problem is not a simpl solut .
there are countri who have decad of experi in tri to integr migrant , are countri without ani experi , like romania , where the issu of migrant will increas hate mainstream .
the fact is that we are talk about million of peopl who are in turkey , lebanon , jordan , who sit in precari camp and who have just start to go to europ .
one estim say that onli 10 % have got to go , winter is over the mediterranean , but we expect the next year to a wave may be even higher .
what do we do with these peopl ?
my pronosticul is that we get use to this problem , we will not look so catastroph in term of media .
vorbeati countri with less experi or higher .
do you find that there is ani place where he realli manag the integr of larg group from a extraeuropeana cultur ?
i look at magrebieni in franc , turk in germani , they are all enclavizati .
i would not go to the radic statement .
sure that their integr is more difficult than other wave of migrat , but that doe not mean that they do not integr at all .
remain part of neintegrata that creat major social problem in franc , in germani , in britain .
but simpli mean politiensti will not work .
to creat fortress europ is delusion .
we have fiddl with the mechan of integr into european societi .
there have been some mistak .
we need to be more demand .
to ask those peopl to learn the languag , to tri to take the valu , not to remain with one foot in europ and one in their countri of origin , and the rest of the famili includ the marriag of conveni .
we have separ but the immin problem of these peopl long-term problem of their integr .
if other have fail in the long-term integr doe not mean that we need to look at how they are drown in the mediterranean .
perhap we have doubt about the qualiti of the valu that come with these peopl .
and if an intervent in syria , which i do not believ , doe not mean that it will restor the countri overnight and you can bring them back .
up to defend the solut , see fortress within europ .
close border , build wall , to reintroduc border control in the schengen area .
the european project is in jeopardi ?
the european project as such , the schengen area as it was built , yes .
it was built quit minim and aranjand rule so that the pressur was too much on the countri that put the foot for the first time these migrant .
i.e . we travel freeli around there , but each is with his problem .
in the face of such a wave can not be so , becaus some countri do not face .
when there are such wave of emot , the politician want to show that they are do someth , but in the long term doe n't chang much .
after the attack in franc do not have a more draconian anti-terror legisl in the eu than we had last year .
it is a wave of public excit that is both way .
and it is so unstabl from one week to anoth that you ca n't make decis base on them .
we have a lot of talk , a lot of bellicos statement from politician at home under pressur to be virili .
and , then , the dramat case of the child drown in turkey and public opinion is emotioneaza .
after go public excit , we go back to the reason whi we creat this space , this freedom of movement that is not onli for peopl , but also for the good .
this is the real european singl market .
and i do n't think the european would give up this principl of libertatatii movement .
there will be other rule is someth els .
schengen is now an anim creat in anoth era , and which was not adapt to the situat now .
romania has play so far in this crisi ?
as a small countri , who believ that , if the cap draw eye and ear pothol , the theme disappear .
the realiti of the flow of migrant , you can choos to be part of the solut or zici that is not your problem of small countri .
that is what we have done , it is a legitim strategi , but after that you re not ask to be treat as the seventh largest countri in the eu .
you are not , do n't play at the big countri .
the big countri come up with solut for the entir eu , good or bad , we are not their qualiti .
as he did in poland .
on the other hand , the effect of this crisi is that the romanian ' appetit for schengen will fall veri much .
presid iohanni say it may well not have alreadi enter .
so move from despair come to a more pragmat posit , but the goal remain .
there is of cours a risk if romania and bulgaria into the schengen as migrant to see us as an altern rout .
what doe not mean that it is a reason not to enter the schengen area , but to be more pragmat .
romania will be part of schengen , schengen and there will be , but in the sens in which the extern border will becom common respons , will be the singl rule for migrant , singl deport rule for those who do not receiv asylum , uniqu rule for countri deem safe .
the ukrainian presid said that after russia move it attent on syria in ukrain has never kill anyon .
there is a link between the two outbreak , a game of russia ?
russia has the power frustrat behaviour .
she believ to be the great power mean to incurci american and european .
from this point of view , yes , there is a connect .
without the financi and militari effort of the putin regim , perhap that the assad regim would have collaps long ago .
and it was good to fall befor his main oppon to be islam state .
a coupl of year ago was a fight between the assad regim and the secular and moder muslim militia , back by western and gulf countri .
he then rais the islam state and now no longer know if the assad regim to fall .
russia was abl to complic thing , but could not particip in the solut .
it creat outbreak of instabl and chao that can shut down .
but you re onli if you have great power and solut .
the game off-sid is just a strategi to gain time .
perhap putin expect to make bid , to press him on butoan to resolv the situat .
bid do not come becaus the world is not convinc that he can resolv in one way or anoth issu he ever creat .
but i do not agre with the theori that say that these peopl are the invis hand .
not to see him on a littl stronger than it is .

the big migrat
romania is not and will not be readi for what will follow .
but europ ?
i say this from the outset , loud and clear : either the 7,000 refuge who should and must naturalis romania is , in itself , an insignific number , but huge in comparison with the romanian state 's abil to manag such a project .
for romania , even the propos voluntari quota of bucharest , amount to around 1,500 occup , far exceed the good intent of solidar with the european union express in recent month .
certain , even if those migrant will accept to settl in our town , the chanc to integr quick in romanian societi are extraordinarili small .
i am convinc that they will be the first to lose their patienc .
parazitat underworld and paralys by a polit class venala , the romanian state prove impot in all area .
powerless to integr gypsi is just one exampl of banal .
in addit to this , the govern of ani colour have not been abl to absorb european fund , to make road , modern school or kindergarten , to ensur a decent healthcar , to collect the mess on the street , to creat job paid respect or to keep their own younger generat at home .
whi would determin the refuge in anoth countri that is run ?
but what produc great wonder is most hypocrisi with which it dealt with such a crisi .
we first fatarnicia belicoasa of strong eu state , which are show utmost generos when it come to share troubl with smaller countri .
then come the pusillanim hypocrisi of romanian who , while million of relat scatter all over the world , have not yet accept the other - the other languag , differ religion , differ blood .
perhap fear not to steal his careva nation be .
in the end , there is a hypocrisi of mani migrant who , although onli invok the horror of war as a reason for the departur , do not accept anoth destin for the brain than germani or the nordic countri .
howev , not all refuge are syrian , and in pakistan is not war .
also , the simplist way in which it is consid the crisi can onli be mock .
we have elimin the caus , some claim , and play strict on the book of polit correct , seek peac and invest for the migrant ' countri of origin .
but there 's peac in romania and even more come from time to time , some foreign capit in the nation economi - but that doe not prevent ten of thousand of romanian to flee their countri everi year .
whi go ?
in this crisi , the european union was reveal as a construct anchilozata , torn and overcom the situat .
deplangeam that romania is not abl to invent a project for the countri , but here is that neither the eu doe not have ani plan for the futur .
and improvizatiil and threat do not help anyth .
then , what is more , if the onli advantag enjoy by the roman - the right to free movement - could be rais becaus of the wave of refuge who cross border with chees ?
at one point , the war in syria will end .
the migrant crisi but not .
in the come decad , overcrowd , poverti , climat chang , resourc deplet etc will push million of desper migrant from asia and especi in africa , toward a better life .
with such politician , romania is not , nor will ever be prepar for what will follow .

corbyn , brexit and the futur of europ
the econom and demograph reason , the prosper enjoy in the past decad can no longer continu in the come year .
until saturday , probabl littl world knew in romania who is jeremi corbyn .
even today , after he becam the new leader of the labour parti in britain , mani are wonder to what extent we can affect the choic of a politician who , after all , is not in a posit to decid .
jeremi corbyn is the most radic stangist of labour leader after the war .
marxist , anti-monarhist ( ask him at one point toni blair , then prime minist , to the royal famili of buckingam palac ) , a fierc anti-american and a sympathis of vladimir putin ( was otherwis regular invit to comment on polit event by the tv channel `` russia today '' ) , and the terrorist movement hizbollah and hama , he want britain to renounc nuclear weapon and out of nato and the eu .
for corbyn , who was consid at the time the kill of osama bin laden as a real tragedi , isi is almost better than the unit state .
the model of all populist demagogu , corbyn has , of cours , the anti-auster miracl solut .
thing like those which they said they were promis and tsipra in greec until the time when the chest with the real world and econom legitatil .
the econom programm of the new labour leader call for , among other thing , the massiv renationalizari and print money as a solut for fund develop project and coverag of some veri generous social benefit .
sure , some might wonder whi the solut with print money is not wide adopt across the globe , we then have a general prosper world ! , but who is to prevent such detail .
sure , we can get those in the blood banker , becom a kind of servic enemi on the left , but from what has been seen so mani time in the past , not onli in the former communist state or in ecuador or venezuela , but also in franc , at the begin of the mitterand and holland 's mandat .
addit amount are quick inghitit by generous promis , without back , made by populist demagogu .
as well the attent of margaret thatcher , `` the problem with social is that at some point over the money of other . ''
few give jeremi corbyn 's real chanc to reach ever prime minist .
in the earli 1980s anoth radic leftist leader , michael foot , who howev was not as extrem in the belief that proaspatul parti leader , has fail miser in the elect .
and then there is still in britain a muncitoreasca class , in the classic sens of the word , relat consist and structur .
and the union were more influenti sensit now .
under the new industri landscap , where servic are domin in the whole workforc , and extens automatizari made in the industri to be massiv need for qualifi manpow , corbyn 's rhetor has a limit appeal .
but , even in opposit , he can influenc import develop that may affect us direct .
in it latest financi time believ the number of corbyn 's elect increas the chanc of brexit , name britain 's exit from the eu .
the new labour leader has been a consist oppon of the countri 's membership of the bloc .
in the eye of the radic left brussel is the agent of intern capit and a promot of globalis which has impos auster on the poor .
when combini this kind of idea with those express by the radic right-w , anti-immigr rhetor and look at the refuge crisi that is shake the foundat of the eu reach an explos mixaj .
and not just for britain .
but if the british decid after the referendum , which would take place by 2017 , to leav the symbol capit loss for the entir european project and the deep fault line creat insid the euro crisi and now whi refuge , between north and south , between east and west , leav room for the most worrisom scenario .
all the more so for a whole seri of member state , london was a counterbal to the franco-german axi ( which anyway berlin is increas becom the domin player ) .
admit , the british busi , the citi , are strong advoc of the countri 's remain in the eu .
but europ today is no longer in the past .
there are a lot of resent , which are grow in intens even in these week .
the problem is that brussel , we had just recent a sampl in the speech of jean clude junker , increas tend to take major decis over the head of the vast major of member state in onli a few european power , main with germani .
and what happen when the elector support for antisistem format , anti-immigr , which are at the same time and euroscept increas dramat across the contin .
in other word , the emot climat with negat cargo arriv at higher rate than ever befor in the past .
henc the conclus that we draw the financi time when assess the chanc of brexit .
the pro-eu option is base on a cold calcul that leav the nation interest .
if voter decid to stroke , then britain will remain in the eu .
but corbyn 's victori remind us the power of emot in the current polici .
howev , eastern europ can be signific affect by such major develop .
especi if , as is expect , we will see a greater integr of the eurozon , which will push most of the countri in the region and the outskirt of interest and that of the decision-mak process in europ .
corbyn , tsipra and syriza in greec , podemo in spain , even berni sander in the unit state are fuell populist rhetor of accumul frustrat in oocidental societi .
the econom and demograph reason , the prosper enjoy in the past dozen year , generous social benefit , can no longer continu in the come year .
under pressur from the explos dual crisi , eurozon - immigr , both caus by rash decis that have not taken into account than integrationist polit ambit , and the abil and willing of peopl and govern in europ to respond to such challeng , the turbul on the contin , the eu 's intern tension will increas in intens and major can affect the situat of romania .
and it is difficult to excluzi someth in term of possibl scenario .
the question is whether our polit leader are abl to cope with such complic situat .
constantin brancusi , farmer 's god .
rockefel : `` how can i help you ? ''
brancusi : `` take matur and workshop ! ''
the great sculptor had a big dream : to be someon , to get famous , to hear about him all over the world .
behind renumelui or hide but someth almost forgotten today , when we are deliv to million of success stori , recip for success in life .
that someth has a name .
it is call `` truda . ''
what to write about constantin brancusi ?
what 's there to say , realli ?
his figur appear on the banknot .
and , recent , a bank in romania has hire an actor to play him in a billboard .
brancusi produc and suppli money in almost 60 year is no longer among us .
in romania , there are hundr of street and boulevard that name after him .
otherwis , even the author of this text resid on one of these street .
and , when it hit the outsid with odrasla hear the follow instruct : `` go into the park , brancusi . ''
the countri is impanzita of it statu .
there are few romanian person whose work to be known as much of the world , from children to the elder .
the abil of brancusi 's infiltr is huge .
neither the communist fail to extirp in memori and cultur of romania .
his recit dot the internet today , receiv hundr of thousand of like and share .
and , then , again , what would be said , write about this man ?
view from the pile of book and articl that tri to recreat the destini , brancusi 's life seem almost fantast , total improb .
you know , there are those peopl who tell you that if you have n't had the good fortun to you re born in ani larg citi and in a reason affluent famili , your chanc of success in life are almost nil .
contraexemplul brancusi 's life is perfect .
and mayb there would be a key .
mayb there should be start the text that follow .
with a sentenc , no matter how loathsom they are .
look cretin success stori , which are deliv daili in the newspap and on tv .
a close look at figur this man .
do you want to know how to manag in life , how , today , he heard a whole globe ?
it is .
he work all her life to be someon .
did it .

it is the fifth child of maria and radu nicola brancusi .
although it came from a famili of wealthi peasant , brancusi lead a modest life , but one that had to collect the benchmark that will guid the artist vision of late .

and you know whi thing have chang ?
civilis great citi came up to us .
brancusi 's copilaria was far from a bucol .
one of the moment that happen in these earli year of life is veri apt for the combin of puriti and violenc that have characteris the futur sculptor year spent in his nativ villag .
it is reproduc the work `` brancusi . a biographi , '' written by alexand buican .
in 1879 , constantin brancusi was 3 year old .
in the autumn of that year , when it was plum brandi `` cazan , '' those who own lichidul sampl to see if the process is carri out proper , brancusi come at a time of general inadvert .
fill their causul palmelor with plum brandi and drink on nerasufl .
fall in his sleep almost instant .
the first peopl see onli after a few minut .
mother into panic , then the hysteria , believ that her son die .
later in the day , when the father , radu , return from vineyard accompani by lautari , he see in the desper sign of those ahead of him hold their breath .
the parti turn immedi in jale .
the father is alreadi at ingropaciun .
howev , one find that it is good to summon the baba brandusa , doftoroai and servitoar brancusilor said .

while the boy is left to sleep on betia , joy , the parti with the lautari continu with more forc .
the next day , the father and son meet through the orchard .
radu constantin brancusi put him on to collect some nuiel and to bring them .
the father of the child with his head down and , with nuielel brought the boy , knock him to rememb .
and , while he feel usturimea blow , the tini brancusi is the revel that the world can be view from anoth perspect and that thing can appear around capsiz .
especi the posit of the sun , from the well-known , make him wonder , as you have to admit , if not himself attend astrul 's disturb .
the sun was equal disturb that his father of what happen ? .
at present , the citi is not
an mp is call on politician to rememb those who have vote .
independ mp viorel blajut appeal to the psd and pnl to stop the infight and to refocus the agenda to the elector .
what we see now on our polit scene is a big divis and both .
i have not seen anyth in the usl project in 2012 to continu .
neither highway nor the region hospit for emerg , you see just how politician disput their possibl site depend on real estat interest .
to leav a littl polit asid , to gather and talk .

`` if peopl vote for us , doe not mean that they are fool to vote if you do n't see anyth , '' said blajut , who assess that the main reason whi the elector is no longer interest in polit is alesilor hypocrisi .
