<seg id="1">In an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">During a call to the emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb has presided over that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably distraught, and that contacts on the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the police, she found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white office paper: "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one that ever loved me," it said in a letter signed by Lamb, according to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot a favourite of Professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said staff at the university heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lamb said he made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the end, there was another death; Lamb took his own life when police came for him.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, with mandated authorities still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.</seg>
<seg id="10">Details that were published by investigators on the state and students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">The students confirmed that they were enjoying his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, in thanks to "great people," with whom he shared academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and history, along with other 17 faculty members, and many students went on courses at both at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there have been insights into problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">The student who raised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitating and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was experiencing stress at the end of the academic year of 2014-15.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked Delta State University on leave for health reasons, when he said he had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">And this year he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate in which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">President of the University William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba seemed to be in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="22">Lamb will not answer those questions.</seg>
<seg id="23">After he left campus, police intercepted his lead as he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Misissippi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed by a single shot from a gun in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed by the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">He left the car on the street.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb drove to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in this country.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began working at the university, which has 3500 students in the city, which numbered about 12000 people, in 2009, and taught geography and hours of education.</seg>
<seg id="29">He got a doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of long-time friends Lamba described him as a clever, charismatic and funny man.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older kid who tutored her for a few years playing guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was quite a heartbreaker then.</seg>
<seg id="34">The hearts of all the girls softened as soon as he appeared, "says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">During an emergency phone call, Lamb said: "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick home that adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier river.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She was with her mother's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were evicted at the summer festival three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">They later played random gigs together.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, spoils a lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat that Lamb had played on the guitar and harmonica for the unruly crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign of anything wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It was just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were lashing out and recording each other's jokes.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the slain professor, led the seminar in his first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boyhood student club and the government of students.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, took part in commemorative events with candles.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended vigils, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">On Wednesday, the school started again.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is the day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police are now claiming that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there was no evidence that they were actually sedated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict's nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once again, the head of the UN has urged all parties, including a divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation impossible."</seg>

<seg id="1">8 election figures showing Donald Trump in real light</seg>
<seg id="2">Some tried to identify him as a man who often changes his mind.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rest of them waved a hand like an unbeaten joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some prepare for implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead on a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for the nominating chances of this magnate in the area of real estate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts point out that, at this time of 2011, the lead of Rick Perry's path to the rise of Herman Caine, ultimately neither of them won the only position in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups such as the Super PAC Jeb Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and begin to interpret their dollars at a halt with the aim of toppling him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real-estate tycoon is not just a fleeting phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's assessment of the positive has turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, it showed a vote by Monmouth University that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive look at this real estate magnate.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, that was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the start of August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers are held in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="20">After voting for the University of Quinnipiac, which passed last week, it found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN / ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two of 10 said they would be "indignant" from his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson produces roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "thrilled" against the 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">Another closest at the level of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "distraught" if the favourite of Jeb Bush became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his nastiness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to think that the real estate has the magnate's right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is held in the state's Iowa State Club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong to the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When he puts on his savvy hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.</seg>
<seg id="34">On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: The GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">By this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as an award-winning candidate against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump equally defeats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some pundits emphasize that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused between more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University survey from the start of September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads above Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points at each.</seg>
<seg id="43">He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who defeats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would lead over the businessman on a wide 19 points in a hypothetical game of one against one.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bare majority of Donald Trump's followers claim that they have already made their point.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new Tuesday's CBS / NYT poll shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump claim they won't change their mind.</seg>
<seg id="48">It's obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent say they keep an open backdoor for change between candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet Trump is the current strongest opponent of his outsider's fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="52">Indeed, ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "thugs" in the announcement speech of his campaign, immigration still stands as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some worry that Trump's drudgery will lure key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage to rebranding.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to a new Monday poll by ABC / Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration at the government is reaching new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday's ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also very angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A vote by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish angry."</seg>

<seg id="1">The House has supported a greater share of the state from the levy on coal.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic will acquire more than 400 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">The House of Commons at first reading supported the government's amendment to the top bill, which regulates the amount of revenue from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) has promised MPs that it will raise money in addition to both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="5">The draft has been criticised by MPs who worry that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budgeting. The House in first reading has supported the government's new top law, which in addition to other means that the state should receive a greater share of the proceeds of the levy on the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state's share will rise to 67 per cent, while the municipality's share will be reduced from the current 75 per cent to 33 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The draft is also changing the way to calculate reimbursement for the minerals that companies extract.</seg>
<seg id="8">The change in fees for mining operations is to bring to the Treasury about $427 million more than in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's revenue budgets are to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the previous year, commuters received from fees of about $450 million and a state budget of $150 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">From the extraction of brown coal, there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor.</seg>
<seg id="12">The amendment also envisages an increase in the amount of recovery in excess of EUR 1000 per hectare per hectare per year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The income from these remittances remains in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="14">Industry Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) told MPs that commuters would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor.</seg>
<seg id="15">The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The payment shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the mineral extracted and the rates for the different types of mineral.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Government, the reason for the change is that of a flexible response to the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, MEP Mark Benda warned that the pricing of the levy by the government does not need to be in line with the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="19">But, according to Secretary of Youth, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging a nerve that is state-owned.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the case of deep-sea coal mining, there will be three-quarters of the community's money and a quarter of the state.</seg>
<seg id="22">The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.</seg>
<seg id="23">Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="24">For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a year-long rescue service.</seg>
<seg id="25">The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would hurt communities affected by mining and the region.</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prior to the increase in unemployment at Mosteck, Mrs KSČM warned Hana Aulicka.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kádner and Aulicky have failed to dismiss the amendment, and he wanted the law to return the government to finishing.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the explanatory memorandum, it says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, because prices are from more than 90 per cent in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thus, major consumers like power plants or theaters should not feel price growth.</seg>
<seg id="32">"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will offset the increase in reimbursement by trying to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would reduce the number of employees," the government admits.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial that MPs have yet to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="35">If coal is also benefiting from the limits, then it will have implications for yields for both the state and the community, he pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="36">Urban disagrees with the youngster in that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fail until after 2020.</seg>
<seg id="37">The limits on CSA below should be broken for reasons of social, economic, and, because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Happy to lead the Czechs as the one, the deployment will affect the weather.</seg>
<seg id="2">All four English tennis players will appear at Thursday's drawing of a barrage of the Davis Cup in India on the whiteboard, and this time each of them is likely to be hit in the game.</seg>
<seg id="3">Captain Jaroslav Navrátil planned to spread the load on the whole quartet given the difficult conditions.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is heat and high humidity in Delhi, so they expect difficult fights that can stretch to five sets.</seg>
<seg id="5">We have to take that into account.</seg>
<seg id="6">I want to spread it out by the weather.</seg>
<seg id="7">And from what it's gonna look like, he told Navrátil in today's practice of Czech selection in the center of the arts, Kumar Khana.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the one-to-one team and the world's 40-year-old South, he reckons Friday and Sunday's two games.</seg>
<seg id="9">The position of the pair is likely to be because of Lukas Rosol and Radek Stephen.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want everyone involved.</seg>
<seg id="11">I've got it slowly in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be Stephen's participation in Saturday's four-game.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's just a question of who will stand next to the experienced detractors, who have an 18-4 record in the Davis Cup quarter.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's probably not.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are options with Rosolem or Adam Pavlace.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I really don't know who and how it's going to be," Navrátil said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He will decide, according to the development of the two games.</seg>
<seg id="18">The variation may be Pavlasek, with a Merry surprise in the 1-1 win in the debacle over the Australians.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He's a decent asshole," said Navrátil.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've done it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to show the same performance I've shown there since the second set.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I am happy for those experiences and I would like to bring a point," Pavlasek said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The home put in two games by Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ladder), which he won last week by a ger in Shanghai, where he defeated the players in the third and fourth hundred of the ladder.</seg>
<seg id="23">The pair will be Somdev Devvarman (164).</seg>
<seg id="24">Both are players from the Challengers and ours have the experience of the ATP Tour, but we have been convinced many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup have not been decided.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He decides the current form, the weather," Navrátil said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Friday's opening two games will begin at 6: 30 p.m. and can stretch due to the weather.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to the forecast, it has rain and the court is not under the roof.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it may be possible to play artificial lighting.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has already ignited and it has some two thousand luxuries, which is enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It should be put under the lights," Navrátil said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corby will debut on Prime Minister's Questions</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corby's debut in PMQ is very enthusiastically expected</seg>
<seg id="3">New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and will for the first time be working with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully scrutinised by the media and MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a weekly statement, he asked "fewer theatres and more facts."</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem in the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the newspaper's headline pages.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that a Labour leader would recommend the national anthem to sing "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says political differences in the work are also "staged" following the appointment of Mr Corby over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corwas said at the TUC conference that the Labor Party had presented amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit cap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party was "very clear" opposing government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labor Party, who has faced David Cameron over the past decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">The leader of the Workers' Party, which promised a different approach to policy, says he has ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.</seg>
<seg id="18">MP Islington North says the PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both the "post-finished response," and the ozzy trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.</seg>
<seg id="21">When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to divert from the style of politics of "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later, he admitted he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their stance among other MP, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature, and far-reaching reforms are needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Opponents of the Prague landslide of the marsh are cheering.</seg>
<seg id="2">The controversial building has been given a stoppage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.</seg>
<seg id="4">A petition has been held against the building, which is due to come close to the Ania monastery in the centre of Prague, protesting in front of the Office of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Municipality held in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because all the elements of the territorial decision had not been complied with.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The territorial decision in question does not contain, for example, the type of land, the distance from adjacent buildings, sufficiently clearly and comprehensively described in the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory concerned by the construction," it is written in its decision.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also considers that some of the elements for the decision were originally published in the present dossier, but which has changed.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, it is the opinion of the environmental authorities.</seg>
<seg id="9">Part of the building is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear from the writing material that, however, the owner of the land has provided only consent to the design documentation for the territorial procedure, not consent to the placement of the construction on its premises, the Department of Construction is writing.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the Department of Auditors, the Department of Construction did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, that the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.</seg>
<seg id="12">In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="14">The project, which people have dubbed the marquee because of the supposedly proposed color of the facade, is causing strong emotions in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the city centre, hundreds of people have been killed in protest against the building.</seg>
<seg id="16">The association and residents of nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued for a house many years ago, which was supposed to look different.</seg>
<seg id="17">They also criticise the inadequacy of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Atan monastery.</seg>
<seg id="18">The house was designed by the architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original design of the 2008 project, which was envisaged with a glass façade, was rejected on the basis of the National Historical Institute (NPIs) of the Ministry of Culture and repealed the authorisation of Prague memorials in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows but NPIs and the master's memorabilia were approved and a building permit was issued on that basis.</seg>
<seg id="21">The author rejects the rebuke of opponents, saying he never envisaged the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname for pink-and-white diabetes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the start of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are boosting relationships with local food suppliers and building a brand of IGA by marketing in mainstream and social media and events like the Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA traders and suppliers are joining with brands like them on Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tasting in the IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the retailer's food, alcohol and hardware will celebrate its annual investor's strategic day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA business actions and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and business IGA is taking a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will tap into 5 per cent of the food market in these two states during the 12 months since the opening of the first deals that took sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">This week in its report, Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the retail of IGA could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">That prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss of food sales and volumes at a fixed price basis Metcash could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax returns, Mr Kierath confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash loses its share of markets in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest poll by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley thinks sales of food Metcash will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said trading lunches in Melbourne could be "highly likely to disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas's comment.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is known that a board member of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">The market share of the IGA has dropped from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and earnings from the food store Metcash, which delivers about 1200 retailers IGA, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculations, as sales and revenues are under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler has switched to counter-attack and invest more than $150 million a year to meet the pulse prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and helps so retailers IGA re-equip the business by adding fast-growing food and news from the privateers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The executive director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that price-comparison programs and dovish business will catch up with the slump and hopes that wholesale returns will return to basic profit growth of profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis bolstered by President Tennis Australia's Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behaviour rather than criticism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side-loss in recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated by a referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one to stretch to Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a cramp wrecked him possible by Richard Gasquette at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth on location in the second two game behind Bernard Romic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I've been thinking quite intensely that in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little bit drawn into the controversy," Healy says.</seg>
<seg id="9">He destroyed the rocket when he lost for a hamstring in the US, but he's not the first player to pick up anger on his rockets, because I know Thanasi well enough, and I can say he's not going to be proud of this event.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he really controlled himself very well because he was in the US subject to a very provocative circumstance because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated somewhat hard with him.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits well into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's been very respected in the dressing room, he's been in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young kid and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important game, which begins on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all but supports the hometown of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stand-off.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all we want our team to be absolutely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that around him [Kyrgios] was created," Healy says.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick rose very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public rapidly growing, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he can think about it, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and also for him himself.</seg>

<seg id="1">European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closing borders and holding migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted its illegal crossing to stop the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those who have been stranded for an unknown time on the strips of the country between two states are those fleeing violence in their native countries, building their tents and settling down.</seg>
<seg id="5">But there comes a sense of frustration.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" And give the order of the Hungarian police force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some in protest refuse food and water.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister claims it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will need to be discussed with Brussels and other countries in the next few days, "says Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after a block of 28 states did not come up with a unified immigration policy on continuing meetings in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible deal next month or the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German federal chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, Hungary has not committed its hopes to Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's state of danger in the two southern regions gave the authority a greater authority to tackle the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and accelerate judicial cases of discussing asylum.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News Corrections Charlie D'Agata reported that even the inmates were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled from Syrie and other Middle Eastern countries.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing a breach of the 4-metre fence that the government has placed on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets longer jail terms for those who illegally convert refugees.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is announcing the state of emergency," a spokesman for the government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this we are absolutely clear: Illegal crossing the border is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military expected next week, but reporters in the Associated Press on the border observed the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for the home defence, said the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were caught already in the state's territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have penetrated the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities quickly let the fence fix.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was chaos in the main border crossing at the ROKOKE, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and created the crowding of people.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 went in, but thousands stayed outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary as they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Head of Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders reduced by half in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her head start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop of 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase from 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most Democratic voters claim it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision to support the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the sponsors of Clinton are more certain of their choice than those who support other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground on several demographic groups while Sanders has gained several.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton keeps a big head start between women and moderates, but her leadership is narrowing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is losing only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and now Sanders is equal.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Clinton still has a big lead because of older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead in front of Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters in the entire states say she would enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes a candidate for the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 per cent would support it only for being a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps it is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly passionate about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">Views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favourite, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When supporters of Clinton are asked in the open question of why they want her as a candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), following that it's time for her to be president of the woman (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for this job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Supporters of Clinton also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also cited by the great possibility of election and agreement on issues.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would want him to do so - a third of them think he shouldn't run.</seg>
<seg id="23">When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as a second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most common choice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among supporters of Clinton, she said more than half of Bidens as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points when Biden will run, to 30 points without his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; but that number dropped from 78 percent from last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely selector is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, when there was a question of the greater importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer to address problems from greater chances of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, neither a Democratic candidate or potential candidate emerges as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.</seg>
<seg id="31">Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden of all three leads in honesty while Clinton is a strong leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, then twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that view.</seg>
<seg id="34">Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.</seg>
<seg id="35">As for all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as state secretary continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying that their overall view has not affected her at all.</seg>
<seg id="37">But among the American public, this is an overall different story.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public's views on the subject were split in March, shortly after that problem emerged.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while at 36 percent, their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion on Clinton has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six Test candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best placed in honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters have not made an opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="3">Two candidates are responsible for half the electorate in the latest survey and others are left looking for support.</seg>
<seg id="4">Voters from Republicans across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, and have climbed from 23% of the support in the last CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also found that Carson is leading the charge across demographic groups, and eliminates the Trump among university-educated Republican voters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a student died during a pre-mining fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, charges of murder against five people have been filed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the fraternity of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Deng during the start of the ceremony in September 2013 and delayed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, police reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police allege that he had blindfolded, he was wearing a backpack full of sand on a total weight of £30 and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach goal over the frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they found time to change Deng's dress, googling his symptoms and contacting Andy Menga, a nationwide president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris VAGNER said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He failed to revive him and died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the autopsy report, Deng repeated a blunt object to the head, torso and thigh.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overcrowding in the fraternity, and at least one student is dying every year because of the overload since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Brotherhood and their members must be accountable, and this step is important from the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="13">A grand jury of Monroe County has recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assault by overcrowding and criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to contain not only the persons involved, but in case there is an organisation that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will push them to accountability, too," Wagner said at a Tuesday news conference.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity abolished its relationship with local affiliates.</seg>

<seg id="1">This with the tents when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Growth rates will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know all this.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it will take.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the economy, it specifically offers the history of the little originator about the timing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession came after 11 months after the first rate rise and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggression in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets react.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be confused about when the rate hike will begin, but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are indeed more variables in the game.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in the end, the members of the market can make sure that all the fuss because of an increase in speed can be exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be some interpreted as the end of an era of 'cheap money,'" he said in a note to clients Julian Jessop, lead global economist at Capital Economics.</seg>
<seg id="12">By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to be more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">That means there will be adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">Given what the market has seen in the past around a month, the expected rate hike may make the air a little volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a trend to recap stocks after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a lag in monetary policy," said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed hike.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, the market for the last roughly 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - heading into a rate rise in relatively flat in 250 days (average gains of 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with the average yield of 14.4 per cent from the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis of Bob Dolla, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle, and the return is beginning to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recession is a fact of economic life, but raising rates often helps.</seg>
<seg id="21">Currently, the Fed faces some conditions that have not yet existed, and which could precipitate recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most notable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in raising the Fed rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual increase in GDP was below 4.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few expected its retention when it was at just 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, the Atlanta Fed says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and could discover the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants were ready to grow the Fed for a year and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 per cent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study since 1950, all of the increase cycles so far have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the counting recovery," it writes in the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest of those that the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, we are now at 74 months and still continuing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects an increase in rates, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="32">The key difference is that the impact is more rapid on bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the direction of policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase / reduction cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields, they fall immediately, "Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that an increase in rates will cause returns between long- and short-dated bonds, equal to a curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, though "we are still cautious about straining the yield," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusting to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, the credit margin has widened, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win interest rates after raising interest rates, and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinationals with lots of debt are going to get worse as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be larger.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that the" quality "of shares tends to be overcome over the course of three months after the initial rate increase," analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a report for clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheets were overtaken by weak balance-sheet companies in every interest-rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts on average by 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt becomes a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of purely stock games, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised this station for "deafening"</seg>
<seg id="3">He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival</seg>
<seg id="4">He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Retired colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says neither is an original idea</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, the leading MP says, piling fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasters do not do.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that radio station public services seemed to be "deafening" and was increasingly indistinguishable from his business rival.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word" deafened "- but it seems to be changing on Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which began last year seem to be Brits under another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you're trying to do something different - this is two examples that attack me when you're actually just mimicking what we already have on the market, "Mr Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The director-general of the BBC has rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its trade rival in terms of live music and education to the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learned about classical music on Radiu 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.</seg>
<seg id="14">And their commitment to live music and making music is actually at the top level.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I also think that the commitment of Radia 3 to find new music and putting in new works into operation is also very important," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, the regulator told BBC Councillor 3 Alan Davey that it was now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire for the tread on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcast of the Culture, Media and Sports, and were given a hearing by the commission.</seg>
<seg id="18">Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">See why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith ABoy George as judges - was made "in a manner typical of the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from his own stable" if he next starred in a fun series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' royalties on other formats of entertainment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and the blame may be Black Friday</seg>
<seg id="2">The first three months of 2015 have seen a 7% rise in online sales</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month, the lowest growth since 2000 began</seg>
<seg id="4">Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe November Black Friday could be the reason for braking spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and it has become a ghost town from many of Britain's main streets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, experts claim there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending on August was the lowest increase in growth since the early measurements of 2000, with an increase of just 5% compared to last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts claim there are signs of steady online sales, and new figures show a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="10">"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to 2000, it has always been rationalised over time," it says to Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the editor of the IMRG sales index.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones for performing purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to implement purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now (growth) has been somewhat stagnant, and it seems to have subsided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which was relegated from America, is cited as one reason for falling sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe customers could delay purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past year, five times more than the average shopper has turned on its computers to make purchases and agree several websites of sellers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are bargaining again, can hold customers away from other purchases</seg>
<seg id="18">Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one-third of sales are done via web stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.</seg>

<seg id="2">The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets of Muslims in the execution of the first funeral in Mecca</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia is partly blamed for the collapse of the construction magnate of the Saudi Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="4">The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed</seg>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crash of a crane in the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed to some degree in white, mourners picked their way and gave up respect for the victims when the first of the fallen was on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moais.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad message was passing around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building crane breached the ceiling of the mosque and toppled to the faithful.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for the funeral and the Saudi king was sanctioned by a building group of bin Laden's family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bodies of 29 dead after crane crash in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before launching the annual pilgrimage of Haddock.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already promised that Haddock to Mecca will be held and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the shoulder of the crane at the top when it was not in operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Arabic version of the Order, made by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.</seg>
<seg id="15">The English service agency did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses had been banned from travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Early this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crash of a crane into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cowered before the execution of Hadi later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">Binladin Group did not issue any statement on the collapse of the crane and were not given any comment by its representatives for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Royal Order also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">Binladino's family have been in the vicinity of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and have run major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">Al-Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade that the family had renounced in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before leaving millions of people in the kingdom at a pilgrimage, which must at least once in their lives go through every strong muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials say 158 people still remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials determined that there would be one million riyals (£174,000) dedicated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.</seg>

<seg id="1">Head of B & Q says East Europe's traders working for the left-leaning trend</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons increasingly employed by craftsmen, says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of skilled traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point</seg>
<seg id="4">The result is an open 200 Screwfix store targeting shoppers</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B & Q outings across the country</seg>
<seg id="6">Compiled by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">The British are said to be putting up hammers and brushes and passing them on to the employed educated East European artisans to work at their home</seg>
<seg id="8">If you're going with a hammer or a paintbrush, it seems you're in the minority today.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because the British are increasingly employed by craftsmen to carry out the kudos work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, which owns the home-needs chain, says that a large increase in the number of skilled traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting shoppers, and closes 60 B & Q outings.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Laury claims she wants to employ more women in B & Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store do better half.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, the majority of male workers are male.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said there was a need to address rising demographic trends that depicted more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Laury says: "We still work mostly men in the shops.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to get closer to the balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions on merchandise purchases.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a big role in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under Britain's FTSE100 index, has also re-structured her top team to reflect the equivalence between directors of men and women.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff including the executive and finance director.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms Laury claims: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we would take to us.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher announced the fall in mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the business.</seg>
<seg id="24">The result of a trend of Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, is to open 200 new stores</seg>

<seg id="1">December's £600 pension is at risk.</seg>
<seg id="2">"It's a justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Zbynek Stanjura noted that a one-off contribution was good, but in the long run it would be better to be in the standard indexation because it would be reflected in the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We have room to find the mechanism by which we arrange it," said Stanjura.</seg>
<seg id="5">He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was scheduled to roll over the bill next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that the better social situation of retirees is not pink.</seg>
<seg id="7">Higher indexation next year would mean a budget impact of $5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundreds of millions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, the right, recalled that in the past the rate of indexation had decreased.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rapporteur Miroslav Opwar (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction in real pensions in 2016 and later.</seg>
<seg id="10">The veto of the right-hand payout in December will significantly complicate and possibly make it impossible, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, the chairman of ČSSD Roman Greenbelt suggested shortening the time limit for the committee's standards for ten or 20 days, as well as to block the right.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.</seg>
<seg id="13">The bonus should cost the total to £1.73 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">The money is to go from the Department of Work and Social Affairs in particular.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the coming year, pensions should rise to an average of about a century.</seg>
<seg id="16">The allowance should be given by the pensioner's people, who will be eligible for a pension or part of it in December.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even those who died in December would be able to get a pension before paying for it.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, they would have to apply in writing, by the end of next year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pensions are rolling in the Czech Republic on a regular basis in January, with price rises and a third of real wage growth.</seg>
<seg id="20">This year the pension is 41.5 per cent gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="21">For old-age pensions, the state spent $314.7 billion last year, according to the state's final account, which was roughly five billion year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Spending on retirement pensions accounted for 26 per cent of all budget spending and 46 per cent of all spending mandatory from the law.</seg>
<seg id="23">The average full retirement income increased last year, according to data in the state's closing account by 104 to 10.714 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payout of 2.4 million full retirement pensions and about 17,000 relative pensions.</seg>

<seg id="1">It ended the filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger.</seg>
<seg id="2">The last straw in the resolution of the main hero is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, which has run out of strength and patience.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grandmother-Iva Janrobe decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">John is understood to be with his wife, Olga - Efox Balzer on a similar path.</seg>
<seg id="5">He remembers that he used to have his own will and dreams, he wants to be dignified and free to live again.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is eager to regain control of his life - and, as a solution, choose an escape from that background, he said to the story of Nightingale.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners doesn't feel quite free.</seg>
<seg id="8">From the start, it was clear that the main role would be to Bartok, with whom he had already collaborated on the Unseen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet he said the actor, who had appeared in front of the camera for a longer break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised.</seg>
<seg id="10">We talked to each other three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="11">I gave him the script and he said he liked how sad he was.</seg>
<seg id="12">And he surprised me that he seemed to be a rounded sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, before filming the next scene, he asked where he was going to sit.</seg>
<seg id="14">This time he was riding his bike, climbing the rocks and even walking down the hill.</seg>
<seg id="15">And all in record tropical highs, the director noted.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Bartoka, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of it over time.</seg>
<seg id="17">They feed him a little bit of feed, but they close the door so he doesn't think to play it outside the rabbit hole on the tiger.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that's what we're trying to tell our film, commentating on the actor.</seg>
<seg id="19">His wife, who may act slightly negatively on the spectators, has portrayed Ella Balzer.</seg>
<seg id="20">She's not just a negative figure.</seg>
<seg id="21">She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and mean well.</seg>
<seg id="22">But at the same time, he's an usurper, and he wants to take care of his husband to death, Bajgar said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The film also depicts the fates of Jane's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelm and Pavel Beret - and the zebras of Eric and Pepper - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohook.</seg>
<seg id="24">The producer of the film is Peter Erben of Logline Production, the co-producers of Czech television and the Radio and Televizia Slovakia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czech member of the European Parliament for the Movement, Paul Telik, has postponed the forthcoming Thursday trip to Baku, because the Azerbaijani authorities have now cancelled the official part of the visit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bogdanovsky did not rule out visiting Novosibirsk that in the future the Russian air base in Syria would emerge.</seg>
<seg id="3">We don't have such plans yet.</seg>
<seg id="4">But nothing is ruled out, he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Syria, Russia already has an airport naval base in the port of Tartus, which it has yet used more as a service and logistics centre.</seg>
<seg id="6">But according to reports of the Russian press, from the start of August, the supply of Russian weaponry and military material to Syria has risen.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Moscow, there are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Pentagon says the Russians intend to set up an air base at the city of Latakiya, which for now remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.</seg>
<seg id="9">Washington, however, is not entirely clear about the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, US commentators agree.</seg>
<seg id="10">US Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third phone conversation in the past ten days.</seg>
<seg id="11">Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to convey concern about the gathering of Russia's arsenal in the vicinity of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="12">White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the support of ASADA by Moscow for a lost bet.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Russia's policy objectives in Syria, he said they were rather vague.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow has made its satellite out of Syria.</seg>
<seg id="15">It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="16">The war in Syria is supposed to be the main issue of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation in the Russian press.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Russian leader, on the other hand, said he was not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to today's report by the New York Times, the US government does not rule out President Barack Obama with the Russian president during a UN meeting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But opinions among White House aides are said to have diverged so far.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sesame oil on a greyhound diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.</seg>
<seg id="2">A good way to increase the flow of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.</seg>
<seg id="3">When pressing for cold seeds, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallstones.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">These, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, have been the most common cause of Czechs "deaths for several years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bile inflammation afflicts mainly women, helps sesame oil.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are among the Asian cuisine lovers, you must not miss the sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of the dishes and has a range of favourable health effects.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is often used in bile diets.</seg>
<seg id="11">The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of bile stones.</seg>
<seg id="12">These are from 90% cause of bile inflammation, and women suffer these difficulties 3 times more often than men.</seg>
<seg id="13">Generally, the problems with gallstones relate particularly to overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sesame oil can also be used with the success of the liver diet, which is very similar to that gall bladder.</seg>
<seg id="15">If people want to use all the health benefits it brings to the consumption of this oil, they should be wary of merchandise from the exotic grocery store.</seg>
<seg id="16">The producers of Asia often use roasted seeds that have a sharper flavour.</seg>
<seg id="17">Oil, however, will lose all active substances, described by Ladislav Hačecký, executive director from Czech firm Bohemia Olé of Kraslic on Sokolovsk, which produces bio-virgin oils pressed for the cold.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame seeds.</seg>
<seg id="19">In an hour, he'll be able to pick up eight pounds of seed.</seg>
<seg id="20">By mechanical pressing the raw material will heat up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the label of the extra virgin.</seg>
<seg id="21">At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutritional substances.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sunflower oil thrives on diseased hearts and arteries.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Jarmily Hamerski research, which led to Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred him in the warm kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="25">In fact, he is not suitable for frying, at 180 ° C, he is starting to burn.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is better to use it, for example, to catch salads and throw in particular in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="27">In fact, it contains a high proportion of omega-6 saturated fatty acids, which are most likely to lower cholesterol levels from all fatty acids.</seg>
<seg id="28">On heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of overall intake fat and calories.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, in one spoonful of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in a spoonful of rapeseed oil is 99 calories.</seg>
<seg id="30">As regards the energy value of food, it is important to recognize that natural foods with nutritious substances than so-called empty calories are much more appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="31">These are part of an industrial-engineered product.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.</seg>
<seg id="33">The sunflower lasts as much as the sesame and hemp nine months.</seg>
<seg id="34">Storage in the fridge will still extend the shelf life.</seg>
<seg id="35">Old oil people identify, in particular, bitter taste.</seg>
<seg id="36">On the contrary, he was not at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.</seg>
<seg id="38">Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.</seg>
<seg id="39">The seeds of technical hemp tend to be the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is believed to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.</seg>
<seg id="40">This mark owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega-6 unsaturated fatty acids.</seg>
<seg id="41">These essential fatty acids cannot make the body itself, and one must accept them from food.</seg>
<seg id="42">The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="43">A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="44">The men in France and Greece will consume it 0.6 grams, and the Icelanders will accept 2.5 grams.</seg>
<seg id="45">The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.</seg>
<seg id="46">Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a support diet to boost immunity and heal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="47">It has anti-inflammatory effects and is a necessary part of cell membranes.</seg>
<seg id="48">People do not need to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.</seg>
<seg id="49">The fact that this oil path has been found for consumers is confirmed by the fact that in the company of Bohemia Olé is one of the best sellers.</seg>
<seg id="50">500 grand a year.</seg>
<seg id="51">People often use one spoonful of fasting after the wound.</seg>
<seg id="52">Hemp oil is not flavour-specific, but it will make a great boost to the immunity, advised by Daniel Wolves of the kraut-based company Bohemia Olé.</seg>
<seg id="53">According to the statistics, the most passionate nation is grilled by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="54">For one household, there are 1.4 grills.</seg>
<seg id="55">All over the world, there are all sorts of contests in the grilling that only confirms the success of this culinary discipline.</seg>
<seg id="56">Nor are the Czechs behind.</seg>
<seg id="57">Based on consumer surveys of the English market, we find that only 4% of people have not been grilled in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="58">The vast majority are then grilled a few times a year.</seg>
<seg id="59">To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - ideal to trim the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.</seg>
<seg id="60">Which oil is the best thing to do and at the same time, at the barbecue, will it leave the health of a beneficial substance?</seg>
<seg id="61">In general, the grilling process itself should be economical with fat.</seg>
<seg id="62">Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its flavour at high temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="63">Healthy extra virgin oils also come from the body of beneficial substances that we otherwise gain from eating the oils from the dishes adjusted at lower temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="64">But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't find their applications during the grilling.</seg>
<seg id="65">Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="66">When it comes to meat, experts from Bohemia Olé of Kraslic on Sokolovsk will immediately recall grape oil.</seg>
<seg id="67">It complements the flavour of the masses and the fish.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the kitchen, it features a unique characteristic of raising the natural flavour of the meal.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also is suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="70">Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, it describes the benefits of the grape oil of Daniel Wolf of Bohemia Olé, which belongs to a few of the English producers of this wine grape.</seg>
<seg id="71">Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.</seg>
<seg id="72">It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="73">In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.</seg>
<seg id="74">Thanks to the positive content of these substances, it helps lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="75">By eating grape oil we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, it is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and broken hair.</seg>
<seg id="76">Chef Ramsay appreciates the use of grape oil in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="77">Not only is it appropriate for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when eating salads, but also for the heat treatment of the dishes.</seg>
<seg id="78">So the grill can be used in two ways, marinating and barbecuing itself.</seg>
<seg id="79">By marinating the meat and fish, we preserve their succulence.</seg>
<seg id="80">Three components must be present when preparing the marinade: Oil, acidity and spices.</seg>
<seg id="81">The acidity will be delivered by apple vinegar, for example, and thus achieve a softening of the meat.</seg>
<seg id="82">The spice adds a mass of flavour and oil to preserve and delivers the right thinness, advising Daniel Wolves.</seg>
<seg id="83">At the same time, he adds that grape oil is downright ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils, it can pass through dark meat.</seg>
<seg id="84">So the marinated meat or fish are ready to be grilled, how do you proceed?</seg>
<seg id="85">Extra virgin oils are characterised by just a few drops in preparation of the dishes.</seg>
<seg id="86">The same goes for the barbecue.</seg>
<seg id="87">Some of the oils are complete taboos for this method of preparation.</seg>
<seg id="88">This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">Before the barbecue, rub the oil, stop eating your food.</seg>
<seg id="90">The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of the barbecue.</seg>
<seg id="91">Practically anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad, and many more are useful for grilled meat and fish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Chef from Bohemia Oilers recommend a salad of the Hot Summer, for example.</seg>
<seg id="93">For him you need: • 1 ks of peaches • 1 volume of rucks • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons grape oil</seg>
<seg id="94">Into the salad bowl, add to the mixture of salad leaves of shredded rucola, sliced cucumbers and to large cubes sliced peaches.</seg>
<seg id="95">According to the flavour of the salt and pepper, you can also get a mousse of chilli and soy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="96">At the end, pocket a few drops of grape oil.</seg>
<seg id="97">For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Multiple sclerosis: Not only drugs, but also on the will of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2">Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs a range of experts: Neurologist, physiotherapist, ergoterapeut, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, and many other specialists.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this is not only about treatment, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations if they choose to have a child, including social-welfare advice, recommendations on housing, etc.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet all of this is not enough: The development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">The more he actively struggles with the disease, the longer he can work and may not fundamentally change the style of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6">As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick releases room for disease activity.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, it has been shown that the regular movement has significantly delayed the time when the sick needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.</seg>
<seg id="8">Importantly, patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a trolley.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is why the site has been given a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most important person in the care of sick with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.</seg>
<seg id="11">In multiple sclerosis, there is twice the saying that what the disease starts to treat sooner, the doctor may have something to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medina from the Neurological Clinic of the General Hospital in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses the weakening of lower extremities or disturbances of the balance.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the sick, they work according to their individual needs: To maintain the condition, improve the walk, increase pelvic floor, reduce swallowing disorders, or improve coordination.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's really individual, it depends on the particular difficulty of the patient," says Dr. Martin Kövári, a Mayor of Clinic rehabilitation and body medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.</seg>
<seg id="17">People with multiple sclerosis are suffering from the same disease, but they are shown in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always mitigate its symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="19">But movement activity also strengthens the body's immune state, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.</seg>
<seg id="20">The other positives of regular exercise are the fact that the sick check out what they can do, and that reinforces their confidence.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The exercise is also washed out by endorphins and you feel good about it," Dr. Kamila lashes out from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital of the Royal Vinohrady.</seg>
<seg id="22">By influencing the physical side, we operate on the limbic system responsible for emotion.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are directly intervening in the psyche and immune processes, and we stabilize the disease, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Previously, these patients were so-called saving, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr Paul Kolar, a senior Clinic of rehabilitation and body medicine at the University Hospital in Motole.</seg>
<seg id="25">The goal of physiotherapy is to allow one to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job assignment.</seg>
<seg id="26">As a result, physiotherapists cooperate with ergoterapeutics so that each person has a compensatory device tailored to him for peace.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many patients also need care for a psychologist or a psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="28">They're in a tough situation.</seg>
<seg id="29">When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shaken up.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are experiencing shock, panic, fear.</seg>
<seg id="31">They have to respond to the big burden - loss of health.</seg>
<seg id="32">With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go after someone, not try to get carried away on our own shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I work with them to ultimately conclude that even with a handicap, it can live a fully-fledged life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malin-Schubert of the Neurological Clinic General Hospital in Prague.</seg>

<seg id="1">Without the Prague producer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that can't be made and processed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yet, in addition to the super-accurate, computer-driven machine tools, alongside autoclaves for composite composites, they encounter something as common as apricots pecans.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a drum that resembles a pot of cotton candy, in a pile of pegs, the edges of the tin parts have just come out of the milling machine.</seg>
<seg id="6">"No one better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsky, director general of the airline's Latecoere Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">A full door for Airbus A320 is produced in the area in the Prague Letteries.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the only ones in the world, they are supplying the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.</seg>
<seg id="9">The door, the part of which is assembled in Prague, also enters the first and upper classes on the upper decks of the world's largest transport aircraft, the Airbus A380.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.</seg>
<seg id="11">Accuracy is the main motto here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Perhaps the moment keys leaves the company to adjust twice a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Should the yellow label miss the inspection record, they should have to explain to auditors from Airbus or Boeing in Prague, who travel regularly to see if the door is produced according to the agreed rules.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the human senses have not yet fully recovered the advanced technique.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are 1,500 rivets on one of the doors to the A320.</seg>
<seg id="16">You have to manually break the rivets.</seg>
<seg id="17">It takes two days.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even by the sound of the hammer, they'll know if the ripper is properly cracked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The tolerance in which they are moving is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rivets can rise from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the plane's surface.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's roughly double the thickness of the human hair.</seg>
<seg id="22">In control, he will come to a number of trained hinterland.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the controller runs his finger along a line of rivets, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then he'll take the exact conditioner to the hand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Letov had a program of an L-39 trained military aircraft prior to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in 1991, neither did one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company had to find new contracts quickly.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was then put together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="29">She won a selection process for an emergency door supplier for the A321.</seg>
<seg id="30">The courtship with Boeing was not that happy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We were a small firm for them at the time, which didn't have enough money for investment and for Boeing to guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubsky recalls.</seg>
<seg id="32">The door to the American manufacturer would remain closed if Letov did not attend the French group Latecoere's Prague international association in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="33">I was talking about our co-operation with Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="34">The next day, negotiations were underway with the French, says Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="35">A year later, Latecoere had bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for the A320 was started.</seg>
<seg id="37">Three years later, the doors of the upper deck for the A380 were added.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2006, the company built a new hall for processing composites for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.</seg>
<seg id="39">Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these great contracts.</seg>
<seg id="40">Maybe we would do parts or small parts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Partners want to guarantee supplies for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.</seg>
<seg id="42">Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over $2.9 billion and profits after tax of $147 million.</seg>
<seg id="43">Exclusive status among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.</seg>
<seg id="44">Latecoere has invested £1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.</seg>
<seg id="45">The company must have certificates of quality, certification of 170 specific production processes and qualifications for key staff.</seg>
<seg id="46">Without them, the company would not make any door to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="47">Obtaining certificates that production processes conform to customers "demands, and in repeated checks, keep them on hold according to Dubai millions of kronor.</seg>
<seg id="48">Production processes change every year.</seg>
<seg id="49">They are more accurate and stricter.</seg>
<seg id="50">We have to train staff, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the process, adds Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now the company is completing the preparation of a process for coating zinc and nickel to replace the past for human health harmful cadmium.</seg>
<seg id="52">They received the award from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="53">Boeing people arrive, check the concept of the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="54">Then we show them the production.</seg>
<seg id="55">They'll check our lab.</seg>
<seg id="56">One set of samples will test themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, closing the Dubai way that the customers control them.</seg>
<seg id="57">The reward is the Prague firm's long-term exclusive contracts.</seg>
<seg id="58">With the Prague race today, the production of the Reds is falling.</seg>
<seg id="59">For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.</seg>
<seg id="60">Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European producer.</seg>
<seg id="61">But it does not mean that he could tell any price at the door.</seg>
<seg id="62">Part of the contract is the price curve.</seg>
<seg id="63">It shows how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundred-made pieces.</seg>
<seg id="64">The price is still falling to some limited value.</seg>
<seg id="65">We must enter this price pattern.</seg>
<seg id="66">If not, we will lose, says Dubsky.</seg>
<seg id="67">Half the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete, is yet empty.</seg>
<seg id="68">But he is the symbol of the future.</seg>
<seg id="69">Behind the apron, there is a new semi-robotic line on riveting and fitting the door for an upgraded model of A320 Neo.</seg>
<seg id="70">No, no, no, no, no, no.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's the trend that assembly in aviation is going to take," adds Dubský.</seg>
<seg id="72">The future line is secure.</seg>
<seg id="73">Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.</seg>
<seg id="74">Just a few metres away, there will be a line for the complete assembly of doors for the top deck of the A380.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's a strategic decision by our parent company.</seg>
<seg id="76">The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="77">Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubai.</seg>
<seg id="78">But before that, the company must pass a qualification test for the assembly of some electrical and electronic devices to the door for the largest Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="79">The company is also betting on further development of composite materials.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350, which will compete with the US Dreamliner.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It's a huge credit for the company, when it can process even composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.</seg>
<seg id="82">However, Latecoere is at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="83">In the area of Letov, where he is based, there is no next place.</seg>
<seg id="84">Before joining the French mother, the company had 180 employees.</seg>
<seg id="85">Now it has 800, and within three years there could be a hundred more.</seg>
<seg id="86">As long as Airbus and Boeing are forecasting how many hundreds of new aircraft the airlines are ordering each year, they may not be worried about the job.</seg>
<seg id="87">Although it has contracts for several years ahead, it has faced the parent company of the Prague Latecoere threat of bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="88">The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.</seg>
<seg id="89">In the end, Latecoere was able to communicate with the main creditors.</seg>
<seg id="90">At the end of August, some of the loans traded them for shares.</seg>
<seg id="91">The lenders have gained 37.4 per cent in the company by increasing the capital by 57.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="92">The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.</seg>
<seg id="93">The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="94">The company wrote a new stock of €222.9 million among the existing shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="95">In total, it raised the capital of €280 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">In doing so, the whole group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, who are involved in sales of 85 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="97">Average growth in contracts is expected to rise by four per cent a year until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="98">In a contract book, it has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four-year production.</seg>
<seg id="99">French media claim that Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on the drip.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Czech Republic race in Prague Airlines is significant for the groups.</seg>
<seg id="101">The group's sales contribute 16 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="102">According to the number of employees, the group's largest foreign affiliate.</seg>

<seg id="1">MPs supported a greater share of the state from the levy on coal.</seg>
<seg id="2">The change in fees for mining operations is to bring to the Treasury about $427 million more than in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government's revenue budgets are to have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee is to be higher.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the previous year, commuters received from fees of about $450 million and a state budget of $150 million.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the extraction of brown coal, there were around 200 million kronor and a state of 66 million kronor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The amendment also envisages an increase in the amount of recovery in excess of CZK 1,000 per hectare per hectare per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The income from these remittances remains in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="8">Industry Minister John Mousdek (ČSSD) told MPs that commuters would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million kronor.</seg>
<seg id="9">The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The payment shall be recalculated as a product of the amount of the mineral extracted and the rates for the different types of mineral.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Government, the reason for the change is that of a flexible response to the current economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, MEP Mark Benda warned that the pricing of the levy by the government does not need to be in line with the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, according to Secretary of Youth, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging a nerve that is state-owned.</seg>
<seg id="14">The fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the case of deep-sea coal mining, there will be three-quarters of the community's money and a quarter of the state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock extraction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide a year-long rescue service.</seg>
<seg id="19">The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would hurt communities affected by mining and the region.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, Michal Kucera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the community as yet, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make the Minister of Finance improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prior to the increase in unemployment at Mosteck, Mrs KSČM warned Hana Aulicka.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kádner and Aulicky have failed to dismiss the amendment, and he wanted the law to return the government to finishing.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the explanatory memorandum, it says that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, because prices are from more than 90 per cent in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, major consumers like power plants or theaters should not feel price growth.</seg>
<seg id="26">"On the other hand, this really increases the risk that the mining organisations will offset the increase in reimbursement by trying to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would reduce the number of employees," the government admits.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the rapporteur, the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD) is crucial that MPs have yet to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining.</seg>
<seg id="29">If coal is also benefiting from the limits, then it will have implications for yields for both the state and the community, he pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Urban disagrees with the youngster in that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should fail until after 2020.</seg>
<seg id="31">The limits on CSA below should be broken for reasons of social, economic, and, because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve poised to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would stay idle for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event, because it has been sitting down the years since the Fed lowered its rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the major central bank could be able to get out of the zero-dollar and start the process of normalizing interest rates, "says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy has done relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding a trillion dollars to a government account and creating only a low level of inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.</seg>
<seg id="8">They warned markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest they also see big chances against this move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20: 00 a.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shooter at State University Delta left a message</seg>
<seg id="2">Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day and his colleague - wrote a note in which he claims he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautiere in Mississippi said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock</seg>
<seg id="4">And he said he shot someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Lamb dispatcher asked him to send a policeman to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: 'I shot my wife last night' and also mentioned that there was a "lovely dog" in the house that "won't bother anyone," but he's upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb also did not explain why it was shooting in the house.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police arrived at the scene, she found the body of 4-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamba, in which it said: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she's the only person she ever loved me. "</seg>
<seg id="11">After leaving the note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to the University of Delta, where he killed teacher history Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.</seg>
<seg id="12">The dean of the university, William LaForge, said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite Monday's announcement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss, Schmidt's government offices said there was "no evidence" of the "love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, said she was "a great person."</seg>
<seg id="15">The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steena and Prentiss was "shaken" by the whole case.</seg>
<seg id="17">O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Linklater Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald reported, has been working with Prentiss from the home over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he was "not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When officers caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb acquired a doctorate in education at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months out of the game due to a double fracture.</seg>
<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Lize Championship against PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this left-footer has left this injury in tears and put him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a reckless save by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw pushed into the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nine minutes he was being treated in the playground and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be taken tomorrow or possibly the day after and then continued to operate in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's horrible - the kid who comes to Manchester in 18 years has it very hard but he plays fantastically and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also wearing an oxygen mask when he was in the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="10">He cried.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of his leg will take six months to heal and he won't be able to play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I believe he will still play this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a batting kick.</seg>
<seg id="14">Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalma and a red card.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very nasty surgery with both legs.</seg>
<seg id="18">A tweet from the account of Shaw says: "Thank you all for their news, the words cannot be expressed as I destroyed, my path to recovery starts now and I will come back even stronger."</seg>

<seg id="1">Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?</seg>
<seg id="2">Every parent knows this thing: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn it almost memory.</seg>
<seg id="3">You must not be David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the inquiry of children's schemes to appoint a favourite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, a byte since Dr Seuss, was chosen from 1971.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was hard to pick, writes Cameron in a report published on SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, pathetic, creative and with strong content, I liked to read such to my children because there was always an image or message that I hadn't seen before."</seg>
<seg id="6">All right, after that, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book by an elevator from the 2012 film that added more characters and details to fill out a brief original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree," is the brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">As though it wasn't suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron reads like a summary lift of the Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words, "In the city of Thneed-Ville walled-in, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy called Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of your dreams, Audrey."</seg>
<seg id="9">Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have met the children of the book, where the unnamed young man would know the local nature of the devastation, the trees felled by industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a crouching, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, the relatively minor PR task was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax's child 20 times in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from the office of supporters of Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was at risk of the omission of England but still holding</seg>
<seg id="2">Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England chose on this tour, it will be a repeat of the defeat of the 3-0 that she suffered last time in the Test series, not very likely.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out winning guests either.</seg>
<seg id="4">The side of Alastair Cooper may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good players sleeping in this batting line-up and also the collective thinking is strong; they don't bear the scars of 2012, only a youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is unknown at the Test series, represent an attacking option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in the try series and was replaced by Alex Hale.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyse because his main coach is in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, around the name Joe Root there were no question marks, which led to the announcement because - and I've put this before - the players are their best selectors.</seg>
<seg id="10">A few more half-centuries, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="12">England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I am not surprised by that; he was always a team player.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much Test time will get the batsman to show up is a tough nut.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven caps - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton won nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got a chance at home and out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only thing that you could gripe about is that England gave first chance to Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - although he was Lyth in the best form - but this wasted opportunity is past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here comes Alex Hales and that's the batsman I value very positively.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's the x-factor cricket player we've seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won the 236 on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must be given at least the same opportunity given by his predecessors, but this will depend, of course, on the general assembly in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would gain another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been gifted and I have no reservations against her.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't understand why the strokeaker can't launch and this left-handed man has already shown he's an amazing player of cricket.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and the big difference is not.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former team-mate Justin Langer played first of his first 38 exams before his appearance in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">Three centuries went by, and he didn't look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">The team comes by Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, he took me as a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at its gross statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see it as a pram, but there aren't a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and selectors opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He'll learn a lot about this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Outside the team, England seem to have made some changes and a clever addition to their coach staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches could be a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the most beautiful playing men who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes in part of a tour of the white-ball and will bring in a team of both energy and ruthless spark.</seg>
<seg id="32">I have always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and as much as Mahela possesses the intellect that can be used.</seg>
<seg id="33">New voices in the dressing room, though it's the voices of saying consistent things that have been dealt with before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collingwood's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even if many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions can never be taken lightly.</seg>

Corby to the head of the Labor Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.</seg>
<seg id="4">A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of them because of them - some member states already have enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions, and disruptive changes to the treaty, which they mostly did not want.</seg>
<seg id="5">At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they had denounced social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.</seg>

<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants to be inundated by Britain in European Europe - "We don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggesting that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as has been the case for too long a continued Thatchera (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>

<seg id="14">It's difficult to see how to break my legs in helping the Selfie Britons who might be able to invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>

<seg id="16">"Renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worthwhile from negotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans, to their own detriment, know how ferocious Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical about the EU are the press oligarchs, because they were not inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973, in a 2-1 ratio.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the Saudi-backed Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based correspondent of "EU Rovers" at the start of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included a mixture of villains of unpaid taxes, foreigners hacking phones and the pseudo non-overseas departures that owned most of the big newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a white gorilla, you had to throw bananas at her so she wouldn't put you to dinner, and then also tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, by opposing Cameron's refereeing routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the repeal of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005, and won the card bouncy.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press never forgave him.</seg>
<seg id="24">But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he should not be wasting my time on me - it seems to be in danger of a renewed strategy of boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of engaging media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC on Sunday has left.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say nicely, evolves.</seg>
<seg id="27">He argues that he would like to remain in a reformed European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people out of the frenzied tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.</seg>
<seg id="29">The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not be committed to admitting that Corby's appointment of abrazing McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty, without going too far and losing his job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hillary's game was much more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Ben's phrase - it seems not to have been what McDonnell said, even what JC had told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he also touched me - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of TV transmission, and especially in the faith, the painstaking paranoia and betrayal that social media is</seg>
<seg id="34">It's fair not to provide Cameron's free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to regard the support of the Labor Party in the referendum campaign for the obvious, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnello and Corby's basic rudeness about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences in the central nature of dogmatic bickering.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his crackdown on Nato - Tom Watson is confident that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of it all for their home masters.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of the concession of Britain when it seems unnecessary?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States is already quite disappointed in the brisket "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's launch of what was called the Security Forum of British influence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England</seg>
<seg id="2">A statement by the government-funded agency about being e-cigarettes about 95% safer than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people from whom some have links with the tobacco industry, the researchers report.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published a "landmark" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, several researchers have questioned the breadth of the data and have drawn attention to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">The editorial in the tech journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely shaky base" on which PHE based its main findings.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other experts writing for the BMJ have questioned claims that were reportedly "built on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The underlying principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They indicate that the public could expect a PHE statement that reads "the current best guess is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to draw up the analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) decision to synthesize their views on the damage associated with the different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly already received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.</seg>
<seg id="12">It also approved the mandate of public health BAT in the sustainability report, it says.</seg>
<seg id="13">One in 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of e-cigarettes, but not the funding allegedly obtained earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for selecting members of the panel is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of e-cigarettes, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.</seg>
<seg id="16">A meeting in PHE also took part in the tobacco leadership.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report created in this group "eloquently admits," the lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or restrictions is described in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had already been answered before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One of two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence suggests that health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what they don't show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people a year die from diseases related to smoking and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">A clear highlight of the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risks, bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should quit with EastEnders, says former director of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcast programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for a hit show such as Albert Square.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programs not made by other British television broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for putting public service programs likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into complex broadcasting times over its rivals "biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After Generally Director Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I struggle with the idea that the BBC backs up and sends out programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without the state's contributions," Johnson said in the Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the BBC's future.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you retain the royalties I am not sure about whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term, the production should be reduced at least in terms of programmes that do not produce or exclude others.</seg>
<seg id="8">They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcasting time because they want to get the widest possible support into the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and of course meaningless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programs that can be funded by no-contributor.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and understandably produced on home soil.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt vindicated by gaining ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comment on the BBC's most popular show repeats those former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his Mactaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said even the more pampered public service programs of the BBC "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission to justify a £4bn income from royalties," But, of course, we do all these obscure programs that no one is looking at. "</seg>
<seg id="18">They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a regressive system about who gets the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people, for whom £150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they pay so much, because they don't look at the BBC so much.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who stepped down before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its reigning mission in terms of "informing, educating and entertaining."</seg>
<seg id="22">He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production has now been classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take on a pattern of public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which only a handful were sent off on television, and to connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">This video shows how sound impulses influence the direction the patrols are moving.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tiny patrols change direction by the time they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity by light</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists said these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, said for the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are implanted in the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polishes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">As he discovered, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves that then pass through the body of worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">Enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channel TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some worm cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thanks to the sound waves, these channels are opening up and activating the cells they are associated with, the report says in the journal Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To control the tubers using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels of TRP-4.</seg>
<seg id="14">When then used on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and carried to worms, where modified motor neurons were switched on.</seg>
<seg id="15">The new method is akin to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and switch neurons through the light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike the light, which must be sprinkled with optical fibre to the required site in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.</seg>

<seg id="6">Three-seater missiles!</seg>
<seg id="7">And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!</seg>
<seg id="8">The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertisement for the world's biggest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes across defence and security facilities International cheerleaders in the Excel Centre in the London borough of Docklands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Related: DSEE arms trade: Authoritarian regimes descend on London</seg>
<seg id="10">But a separate campaign is also conducted with emerging posters on bus stops and metres that require a second look.</seg>

<seg id="12">This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms deal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismalands.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collection called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 for a piece of Allen's key, which reportedly "will gain access to around a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."</seg>
<seg id="15">Transport for London is not amused by this flypostings "vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a specialist assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="22">They toyed with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colourful colors and animations, I have achieved that it will attract more people."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They've done a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is for the UK government to take measures and ensure that it does not deal with torture equipment illegally on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside the Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight gold rules for life on student college</seg>
<seg id="2">11 years ago, I moved on to student tracks as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in bereavement and moral relativism, but until now I recall the tense smiles of those I wilted - and numerous, lengthy complaints on the other.</seg>
<seg id="3">All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving onto the rails can range from slightly to nerves passing through to totally appalling.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to babble: To tell people where you're from, if you took a year of break, what's your opinion on Corbyn and why "you honestly don't really love Marmite because, people, it's just an extract of yeast hahaha, I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a deep breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others to also take a breath - ask and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's directing the conversation and helping you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't even talk to if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they would put out the fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Leave the people alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, places of film evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't even think about starting college and being in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts on high will come in short.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a sanctuary, yet a lot of the tracks change to an off-campus walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone who needs to pick up.</seg>
<seg id="15">No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialising - and maybe write him a place of knock.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: Knock.</seg>
<seg id="18">One boy in my tracks had a habit that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw a few things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends through baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because you started going to university at the top of a peaking mania, a knock on a stranger's door and a show with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering domestic delicacies is a good way to find friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and maybe everything will end up adding your face to a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, of course, is the object of being a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and fat are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock them on the door.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime on student college.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stealing the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk into your tea theft?</seg>
<seg id="28">Double check with the owner of the milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a chance that the milk will be offered to you even if they are whittled inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who has replaced her milk for washing dishes to punish the thief.</seg>
<seg id="31">He's in jail now.</seg>
<seg id="32">You shouldn't be making noises that disturb people from sleep or studying.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also responsible people in glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">The girl from my hallway asked her neighbours if they could turn down the drum and bass, because they were 3 at night and had a written in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">Their response was the amplification of music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally shut down at 5: 00 in the morning, she'd let them sleep for two hours and then let go of her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour test.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same dorm as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">And on the contrary, it wouldn't be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommate for your future husband, sleep together, break up, and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your mutual friends, too?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, you don't want to break your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to have a little talk with your weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="40">In a buoyant moment when you realise that someone left the keys in your unlocked room, there's only a thin line between funny and bullish.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroying someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock their doors and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects of the future.</seg>
<seg id="2">Eva has endured a cruel moment in her pregnancy with the seven-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="3">His daddy broke up with her and on the preparation and education of the child was alone.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the situation I settled quite quickly - I was looking forward to the baby and looking at the positives.</seg>
<seg id="5">The uncertainty and the fact that I was going to be alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.</seg>
<seg id="6">And I certainly had a chance in myself that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time, recalls Eva today for her first pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="7">She'd already met on the internet in the old Vasek chat room, and they started talking about their favorite movies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Vasek Eve with More has even imported home from the hospital, but he has not played too much into the role of stepfather.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva said in the documentary series Four in that 3.</seg>
<seg id="10">The theme of the third series of Czech television is the search for happiness at the second attempt.</seg>
<seg id="11">The care of the Visa and the financial security of the family has been handled through part-time work and great help for both the mother and the help of the aunt.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not spoil your affection for Eve.</seg>
<seg id="13">They finally got together around Victor's second birthday, and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also calls him that.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although Vasek already has two grown-up daughters, fatherhood at 60 is enjoying his words, and children are also more devoted to them.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to the Welcome to them, there were still two-year-old Leonkies and, finally, the twins.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Vasek has floated so naturally in our family, perhaps even by the fact that my mother has never spoken to me in relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not enough room?</seg>
<seg id="18">At least we're close.</seg>
<seg id="19">Twins Ema and Ela were born to the Caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then present in the excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant and are shown in particular.</seg>
<seg id="21">The disease is dangerous to unborn fetuses, who are at risk of premature birth and death, with mothers after childbirth mostly spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="22">Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and your happiness, although they were only in the 36th of the week.</seg>
<seg id="23">Emilie was placed in an incubator in the intermediation ward, where she also works for your niece, who was able to take over and accommodate her.</seg>
<seg id="24">Eline was larger and, after being transported from the ICU to the room, I had it on me, describing the difficult times after the birth of Eva.</seg>
<seg id="25">She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until doctors had vowed to release the babies, who, meanwhile, managed to reach the border of two khal.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the wait for bringing in the children of Eve was not a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I was mad with a stitch after my husband and children," he recalls a difficult moment on the department's six-year-old mother.</seg>
<seg id="28">She was also thinking of her husband and the signing of the reversion, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it did not happen in the end, and doctors dismissed Eva and the twins into home care.</seg>
<seg id="30">The story of four pregnancies and births sends the QT1 on Tuesday night at 21: 45 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="31">A large family can be modest.</seg>
<seg id="32">They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eve had to do with an electric double-fence and cramped conditions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The dollhouse did not increase, but Vasek made Eva's joy by installing a gas cooker to make meals for six people more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="34">If he's the best, we'll be shooting a cab.</seg>
<seg id="35">Eva is convinced that children, in particular, perceive the family's wellbeing and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the homage of the cottage.</seg>
<seg id="36">For now, we have sat down very nicely, better than we expected.</seg>
<seg id="37">The clutter is harder to hide in a small space, and the puddling of the babies sometimes crosses, but at least we're all around, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Your work lighting up on the film is not a guarantee of regular income.</seg>
<seg id="39">That's why he occasionally trips to Prague's streets as a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="40">In his sixty years, according to his words, the care of both the family and the children is physically manageable, how long will it be?</seg>
<seg id="41">"I realise that, given our age difference, I will be the one to feed this family," Eva admits, in questioning the future.</seg>
<seg id="42">She would like to return to employment, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.</seg>
<seg id="43">With four kids, I'm not exactly the same for the employer.</seg>
<seg id="44">And if it's the worst thing, my husband and I can shoot a cab, joke a nice blonde.</seg>

<seg id="4">The two last then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.</seg>
<seg id="5">For now, the trend of the Apprentice has been that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="6">The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly over previous iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indeed, the two-gramma mass of the difference to the detriment of the news was negligible.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this is far from the case for new iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="9">Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, weight grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, larger then 20 grams.</seg>
<seg id="10">One side cannot be surprised; last year, Apple's pockets were greatly troubled by the blowback in Apple's pockets.</seg>
<seg id="11">The snacks are so out of the more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which has also been projected on the mass.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a much bigger impact on her have displays.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, Apple has used a 3D Touch technology that makes the displays discern the power of touch.</seg>
<seg id="14">To do so, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacity sensors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The mass of displays of new iPhones has grown more than twice as opposed to previous generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">For smaller iPhones from initially 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.</seg>
<seg id="17">For iPhones 6s, the display is the hardest-used component.</seg>
<seg id="18">A weight of just 143 grams is then reached on this news, thanks to the defrosting bark that touched most of the remaining components.</seg>
<seg id="19">The larger model is then the hardest part of the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way relative to the predecessors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Even in this case, the biggest increase is noticeable on display.</seg>
<seg id="21">The weight of 5.5 "iPhones 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.</seg>
<seg id="22">How practical the new display technology will be in use.</seg>
<seg id="23">The first users will be able to test this on Friday 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Are cereal breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?</seg>
<seg id="2">In Italy's Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have made a finding that opens up interesting possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="3">There were traces of the settlement of modern humans from various times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="4">But in a layer of 23A, which, according to the instruments, dates back to about 30,000 years ago, however, scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, there were traces of oats in place, which seemed to go through the production process today.</seg>
<seg id="6">In it, the grains dip first today, then dry, dispose of the packaging, the so-called plush, then save and flatter the flat.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the cave Paglicci managed to discover the grains that appear to have been heated or saved, and then apparently crushed between the two mill stones - at least that suggests traces of use on two stone in the cave.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, scientists have been unable to demonstrate in their publication for the PNAS magazine that a complete production process would occur in the cave, but the similarity is really striking.</seg>
<seg id="9">We also have no evidence of how the people flakes could eat, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and possibly warm enough, of course, is offered entirely logically.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensively people have used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="11">In fact, if the entry-level interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have passed agriculture by roughly twenty thousand years.</seg>

<seg id="1">New reporting stations in the Dopram Transformation of the City of Bremen.</seg>
<seg id="2">So I once again listened to the names of the stop signs in the trolleybus:</seg>
<seg id="3">Certainly, the trolleybus was a little more noisy, so the message in the man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the stops sounded in the woman's voice.</seg>
<seg id="4">The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is better discernible than a deeper male voice.</seg>
<seg id="5">The DPMB argue that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but I'm sure they picked up from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the noise of the bus engine.</seg>
<seg id="6">I've lived in Brno for quite a couple of decades, so the right names of all those stops are known to me, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know in Brno, and for whom these reports are primarily determined, can be confused and may at the final, where they mistakenly arrive, then claim that the footage they had to speak was not reported at all.</seg>
<seg id="7">Perhaps he would have had the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - to do it again, and this time under the normal traffic noise and the roar of the engine in which the microphone of the speaker on the bus was almost lost.</seg>
<seg id="8">So that we do not have to continue to listen to the names of the stations of the Water Hershek, the Whisperer, or then Ponorous in the creaking sage I've crossed in the Chamber.</seg>
<seg id="9">I suppose my old man's ears hadn't grown so much during the only day that the announcer had changed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Before that day, I understood the message pretty well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Good morning, Comrade Chief.</seg>
<seg id="2">From a tracksuit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, few know what the leaders of the party's biggest and cleverest have been the so-called comprehensive clearances.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took the liberty of remembering.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bus was late.</seg>
<seg id="6">I bumped into the dispatcher's office when I heard from the radio that it was just seven o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="7">"You're lucky you didn't break down with the comrade chief, he came a minute in front of you, and it seems he's not in the mood," the dispatcher observed, while I was writing the pages.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks. I'll be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tell me I'm going to the precinct for a review of minor mechanization.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not gonna work. There's some background checks today.</seg>
<seg id="11">They're all scared shitless.</seg>
<seg id="12">What's the point?</seg>
<seg id="13">"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.</seg>
<seg id="14">Next time, you'll be too.</seg>
<seg id="15">I ran out into the hall.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stiff, stony-faced, in a perfectly fit uniform.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, and quickly switched on two buttons of the uniform jacket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone that the old replied.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You're playing," said Eva, the elderly lady, who I appreciated very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">She said she even was a chieftain before the comrades took her down.</seg>
<seg id="22">They're clearances, and you're coming in.</seg>
<seg id="23">How many times have I asked what these comprehensive clearances are, but no one really wants to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">They say they're going to be one in three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="25">At least for some.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'll see.</seg>
<seg id="27">I pulled the file out of the drawer with periodic reports and then the phone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Holcman, come to me right now," said the chief's voice.</seg>
<seg id="29">What's bothering you?</seg>
<seg id="30">Now we've met and nothing... "I muttered, but no one answered, everyone just with their thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I've come to your order," I said, and I walked into the chief's office.</seg>
<seg id="32">The chief sat behind his desk and looked at some of the papers.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Comrade mechanic," he said after a moment, without raising his head, looking carefully at the paper, "I don't like your behavior at all."</seg>
<seg id="34">He threw the paper down on the table, leaned back in the chair, and stared at me through the usual, unpleasant, prickly look.</seg>
<seg id="35">I was uneasy.</seg>
<seg id="36">What's going on?</seg>
<seg id="37">Yesterday, the Deputy commended that I had worked very well over the few months in office, and that I was very happy with him.</seg>
<seg id="38">The chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at the distance.</seg>
<seg id="39">And now this?</seg>
<seg id="40">Remember, you're a track-distance technician, and that's what you have to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">The kind of greeting you used this morning is just not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="42">I swore I'd use such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong with him.</seg>
<seg id="43">The chief was like a red rag to the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You're on a socialist rail, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the chief said.</seg>
<seg id="45">Plus, you're still confusing your superiors.</seg>
<seg id="46">Once you say "sir," for the second time again, "comrade."</seg>
<seg id="47">But for you, I'm not Mr. Chief, but Comrade Chief.</seg>
<seg id="48">The deputies are comrades of the deputy, the top tradesman are comrades of the top line-up!</seg>
<seg id="49">You must remember that!</seg>
<seg id="50">Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a regular citizen salute.</seg>
<seg id="51">There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...</seg>
<seg id="52">"It's not your preference that you're not in the side," the chief said, his voice calm.</seg>
<seg id="53">But that's what we're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="54">Anyway, remember, you don't have a pre-paid retirement chair up here.</seg>
<seg id="55">That wasn't good.</seg>
<seg id="56">When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it did not look good with the concerned.</seg>
<seg id="57">He impaled me with a cold, prickly look, and I looked for the words to answer.</seg>
<seg id="58">I was also irritated by his haughtiness.</seg>
<seg id="59">He was only a few years older, and he was playing God, in fact, a comrade.</seg>
<seg id="60">Jovial, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, as it suited him at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="61">He was all used to it.</seg>
<seg id="62">He's the chief.</seg>
<seg id="63">In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, was like all partisans, but also non-partisans, tycoon.</seg>
<seg id="64">But the chief towered many, especially those who could claim his superiority.</seg>
<seg id="65">Right now, he was rubbing me in for a complete tie.</seg>
<seg id="66">I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough power not to shoot him in the face.</seg>
<seg id="67">But I would not go back to the Crusaders, let alone continue to make an irritating official.</seg>
<seg id="68">What would I support two kids from?</seg>
<seg id="69">And set up a house!</seg>
<seg id="70">I was crying, but I controlled myself.</seg>
<seg id="71">I'm not gonna give him pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="72">"That's all so far, you can go," the audience said, and began to look closely at the papers he had had in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="73">At 11: 30, they called me.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everyone in the office was already there and on questions about what and how, they answered, that it was going to be good.</seg>
<seg id="75">Only Jozhin said softly, as was his habit, that they couldn't throw us all away, because that job would have to do the co-chief himself with his faithful, and that he was not in danger.</seg>
<seg id="76">The word "comrade" pointed out, as if he knew what the old man had done to me this morning.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.</seg>
<seg id="78">Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long council table, other comrades who should have made a decision about my clerical being or not being.</seg>
<seg id="79">A disciplinary committee, chairman of the ROH, a staff writer, a specialist for special purposes, something to do with the military, and the deputy, my boss.</seg>
<seg id="80">And also the person most important, the chairman of the party organisation.</seg>
<seg id="81">I knew him.</seg>
<seg id="82">An ordinary track worker, undercut the slingshot or pitches of gravel.</seg>
<seg id="83">But also a former bachelorette.</seg>
<seg id="84">There was a rumor that he was no fun at the time, said a pretty beast.</seg>
<seg id="85">Bad languages claimed that he had been out of school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, learned nothing.</seg>
<seg id="86">And when the criminal was cancelled, he ended up on the spindle at the picks.</seg>
<seg id="87">But comrade, yes, the comrade was forged!</seg>
<seg id="88">The chief motioned for me to sit down.</seg>
<seg id="89">There was a little soul in me, an unenviable dart in my throat.</seg>
<seg id="90">The cadaver read a report from the civil committee from the residence.</seg>
<seg id="91">I come from a working family, I am married, two children, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="92">So far, so good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.</seg>
<seg id="93">Then a report from the aisle organization.</seg>
<seg id="94">He copped a report from the civil committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same man.</seg>
<seg id="95">But then it came!</seg>
<seg id="96">The parents of long-time members of the party, refused to appear before the screening committee and then withdrew from the party, reportedly for medical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="97">The chief looked at me sharply.</seg>
<seg id="98">The cadaver noticed it and stopped reading.</seg>
<seg id="99">The chief nodded.</seg>
<seg id="100">It was only worse.</seg>
<seg id="101">I was a member of the city's SSM committee and there I was recruited for the party's nominee.</seg>
<seg id="102">Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.</seg>
<seg id="103">But I got married and the wedding, apart from the national committee, was also in church.</seg>
<seg id="104">I have disappointed the party's confidence in the worst way.</seg>
<seg id="105">That's why I was cut out of her candidates.</seg>
<seg id="106">But that wasn't enough!</seg>
<seg id="107">I had the two children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I went to a church funeral, though it was a former member of the party.</seg>
<seg id="108">All of this gives me a negative attitude to the party's leadership.</seg>
<seg id="109">When the cart was finished, only the tapping of the chief's pencil in the desk was punctuated by a tense silence.</seg>
<seg id="110">Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.</seg>
<seg id="111">In doing so, I kept thinking to myself, "Komunists - superhumans, communists - superpeople." What did I get into?</seg>
<seg id="112">Why didn't I stay at the smiths?</seg>
<seg id="113">I could repair the switches without any of the fucking clearances.</seg>
<seg id="114">But now?</seg>
<seg id="115">The career of an irritating official took hold of her before she began.</seg>
<seg id="116">Go back to the platoon?</seg>
<seg id="117">I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will be out for an hour.</seg>
<seg id="118">"Comrade, how did you investigate this comrade?"</seg>
<seg id="119">Well, according to the report from the previous job.</seg>
<seg id="120">Do you have it here?</seg>
<seg id="121">The corsage was obviously not twice.</seg>
<seg id="122">There was a sweat on the glass, nervously blinking, as if he had been checked himself.</seg>
<seg id="123">He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.</seg>
<seg id="124">"Oh," said the chief with a hint of granite, but often foreshadowed by thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="125">At first sight, he had been praising, teaching with honors, studying an industrialist, working in a piecemeal as a locksmith, the norm filling an average of a hundred and twenty percent.</seg>
<seg id="126">But that's what's missing.</seg>
<seg id="127">Where did you get that report, comrade? "He said, turning back to the cadaver, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that he might not have had to be a cadaver very soon.</seg>
<seg id="128">This is the comrade who gave it to me.</seg>
<seg id="129">Is that enough for you?</seg>
<seg id="130">"Well, when he got to us, he went to the precinct," he said.</seg>
<seg id="131">And there wasn't any sign of him, he was kind of an extra, so I put it in his file.</seg>
<seg id="132">"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this piece of paper was enough," the chief said dryly.</seg>
<seg id="133">The cadaver blinked nervously, and there was no reply.</seg>
<seg id="134">"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the matter of the chief, apparently relieved.</seg>
<seg id="135">For the time being.</seg>
<seg id="136">"What's the matter with you, Comrade?" The chief returned to me.</seg>
<seg id="137">All of a sudden, it's over!</seg>
<seg id="138">My eyes were flooded, I felt hot.</seg>
<seg id="139">There was a torrent of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who deserved no mercy.</seg>
<seg id="140">By subjecting the incomplete report, I said, in the mistake of a comrade's referendum, I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadaver in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="141">I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of building real socialism, supports reigning religious, or even participating.</seg>
<seg id="142">That there was a lot of things I had done, or maybe I was still going to sleep, and I was praying that it would be over.</seg>
<seg id="143">I didn't care anymore.</seg>
<seg id="144">I didn't care that I was going to get out of the mechanic's place.</seg>
<seg id="145">I didn't care that they would take my picks.</seg>
<seg id="146">This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.</seg>
<seg id="147">"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the Party Chairman, interrupting the chief's levity.</seg>
<seg id="148">Here the comrade made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.</seg>
<seg id="149">What a mistake, he did the wrong thing!</seg>
<seg id="150">But he already has his punishment!</seg>
<seg id="151">Don't you forget that, Comrade Chief!</seg>
<seg id="152">What could be worse for a young man than to put his door on the side for time!</seg>
<seg id="153">To open it again, he will have to prove that he has changed to be worthy of our trust again.</seg>
<seg id="154">The uneducated bachelorette sounded like a book.</seg>
<seg id="155">Where did that come from?</seg>
<seg id="156">Is he so literate or parakeable phrases from stealth training and meetings?</seg>
<seg id="157">That's why this young comrade must be given a chance!</seg>
<seg id="158">A chance to prove he had changed.</seg>
<seg id="159">And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?</seg>
<seg id="160">It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade, to support his efforts to repair it!</seg>
<seg id="161">It's your party duty that no one will entertain you!</seg>
<seg id="162">In fact, it's a party obligation for all of us, too.</seg>
<seg id="163">Here the comrade must see that the side has not forgotten him.</seg>
<seg id="164">That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but that she also loves.</seg>
<seg id="165">When the President was finished, no one looked up.</seg>
<seg id="166">No one expected such a turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="167">At least me.</seg>
<seg id="168">"I agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said coldly, trying to take the initiative again.</seg>
<seg id="169">If you had let me finish, you would have heard that I was heading for that conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="170">Everyone nodded their heads in agreement, but they could see that he didn't believe a word.</seg>
<seg id="171">"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reference to the basic means," I said, when I returned to my office, and then I began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="172">Still, in addition to Engineer Evy, everyone was at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="173">She listened silently to my rambling scenes of fresh experiences, and I, meanwhile, calmed down.</seg>
<seg id="174">When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.</seg>
<seg id="175">Without waiting for an answer, she set the water on the stove and set up the cups.</seg>
<seg id="176">In the meantime, she was talking about disciplinary practices.</seg>
<seg id="177">As one report, often full of praise, puts a man in your hand, and the other in which there is dirt, they send a new employer.</seg>
<seg id="178">But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on the top of the picks, and so comrades in the factory didn't know where to send it.</seg>
<seg id="179">And our fellowship?</seg>
<seg id="180">He was just old enough to eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.</seg>
<seg id="181">"He'll get it from the old one," she said maliciously.</seg>
<seg id="182">I'm sure he won't like it today.</seg>
<seg id="183">Keep an eye on him, he's massively.</seg>
<seg id="184">And the party chairman?</seg>
<seg id="185">In fact, a far worse chief, no lidumiles.</seg>
<seg id="186">Zero from the picks that have big power.</seg>
<seg id="187">The coffee began to boil, and then the office filled with the scent of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="188">I dropped a cube of sugar into the cup and stirred the hot potion in silence.</seg>
<seg id="189">I hope I'm the worst out there.</seg>
<seg id="190">Now they don't throw me out, and there aren't any more clearances in three years.</seg>
<seg id="191">Anyway, the Comrade Chief just won't forget today.</seg>
<seg id="192">It came up in the anthology of the literature on TRATI II in the book.</seg>

<seg id="1">The symbol of the village has been revived.</seg>
<seg id="2">The round of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.</seg>
<seg id="3">You can see it by far, because it's located at a fifteen-foot-high mast.</seg>
<seg id="4">People from the wide area call him the "fan of Chlum."</seg>
<seg id="5">For the municipality, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the general emblem that the municipality gained to the occasion of the resurgence of the year in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We asked for a sign then, and the fan, of course, wanted to have one, he knows him around everyone," said the mayor, George Masek.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a bit of a memento of the moment: It is reminiscent of a time when people here have fought for good drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="9">The one in Chlum in past centuries was a rarity.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 1910, they decided to boast contenders for a solution that then suited up to the mid-1980s.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the village, they left a deep well in the village.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three years later, the well was accompanied by a still-metallic structure with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The building was carried out by Antonin Kunc of the Hranic on Moray's cargo of 2,400 kronor," says a commemorative sign on the ground fence of the construction of the mast.</seg>
<seg id="14">The pump after several repairs and the winds of the wind farm served in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="15">On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of fighting began to start.</seg>
<seg id="16">The wind pump has only been left with a non-functional general symbol and the local rarity.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Dominant got operational at this year's hometown reunion.</seg>
<seg id="18">When in 2008, the Chlummies decided to fix the wind round and bring it back on track.</seg>
<seg id="19">They left a replica of the original round - reduced to an average of half a metre.</seg>
<seg id="20">The wheel was confined to the mast, but it must have been taken down that same year.</seg>
<seg id="21">The replica producer did not select suitable material and the wheel could not withstand wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then the Chlummie Dominant had been resting under the roof for several years.</seg>
<seg id="23">From June this year, however, the round on the high mast is spinning again.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the occasion of the reunion, the village ordered the replica of the wheel to adjust and set it back to the top of the iron tower.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the wheel draws utility water from the well just into a rapper's blind shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="26">And over the summer, we completely unplugged him because there was little water in the well.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least it was empty.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In the autumn, the heat of the windmill from the pump will be removed from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Masek explained.</seg>
<seg id="29">Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where it has put the wind round in the general emblem, but is the only one of this kind across the Highlands.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar feature in the character is in honour of the local technical sights, for example, in Chvalkovic and Green Mountain on Vyskaya, in Kuželov on Hodonin, Partutovice, or in Polici on Vsetínsk.</seg>

<seg id="3">We were trained by Georghe hagi then, it was too bad we lost.</seg>
<seg id="4">I hope to score a goal with Sparta now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just the difference that we're not going to lose this time, "Goian continued.</seg>
<seg id="6">This man, who has played 60 games for Romanian representation, is a key supporter of the Greek team.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a stalwart he will face the raiders of the Spartan offensive.</seg>
<seg id="8">There will be a few thousand people, no hell, he says of the Greek duel spartan Hybsh.</seg>
<seg id="9">And he partly suspects what he can expect on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am well known to Fataie, who played in Romanian Astor with my brother Luciano.</seg>
<seg id="11">I've seen all their matches at the time.</seg>
<seg id="12">I know he's a very good attacker, so he also went to Sparta, Goian said.</seg>
<seg id="13">He did not name another soccer player in the Prague Club, and so came the direct question of whether he also knew David Lafont, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and the captain of Sparta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, directed at the Czech journalist.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do you ask me that?"</seg>
<seg id="16">After a moment's silence, he dropped it.</seg>
<seg id="17">We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta was playing a lot of teammates.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has really good players.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Lafont?</seg>
<seg id="20">No offense, but I don't know anyone else except Fatah.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Spartans know very well about Goian.</seg>
<seg id="22">"He has the experience of bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, it's such their organiser of the game," Spartans assistant Stanislav Hejkal observed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Goian already has the best years behind him, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.</seg>
<seg id="24">His time was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester units United and City, from Steauy but headed to Italy's Palermo, also playing for the Glasgow Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="25">We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, the coach says.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European leaders, pitting for victory in the Czech league.</seg>
<seg id="27">For me, there's a favourite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to launch the group with good results.</seg>
<seg id="28">Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.</seg>
<seg id="29">I am in the room with the Slovakian goalkeeper, Tomas Košice, who is very pleased with his opponent in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="30">Me too.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.</seg>

<seg id="7">Due to the entry into the Burzu Securities Exchange, the Company is completing a prospectus of security, which will be submitted by the Czech National Bank to approval at the earliest.</seg>
<seg id="8">The transfer of the holdings and the related transfers of shares will be made in the form of non-public transactions involving only existing shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or to the new investors in the framework of this operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Any offer of shares to the new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company has said in the past that a possible supply of shares could be made up of issuance of new shares or sales of existing shares.</seg>

<seg id="1">A test of the objectivity of Czech television in informing the migrant crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2">Another small test of objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, the broadcast of the main news session of Czech Television.</seg>
<seg id="4">And how did she stand?</seg>
<seg id="5">When they teach journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast of the Czech Television Events.</seg>
<seg id="6">The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the broadcast of the news.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the first minute, when TIME reported the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border, and the attacks of migrants on the police, she called the euphemistically out of patience - throwing stones and attacking metal rods, the current profligate propaganda - judging by the names of the individual reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">Criticism of NGOs - large scope for non-profit organizations that criticize poor treatment of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="10">Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wandering the refugees - TIME has consistently used the expressions of a runner or a refugee and not a migrant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Crucially, it is mainly that the T in the illustration has been used consistently just and only snapshots on small children and women.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, alone in the same broadcast, she said that there were 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ecology in practice.</seg>
<seg id="2">When I once recovered to the doll's apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had fish in the makeshift toilet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The fishes of the home, an insect with a change of imperfect, that is, not making the transition from a caterpillar to a beetle, and the cub looks like an adult, only tiny and gradually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="5">They were disgusting and I hated them.</seg>
<seg id="6">First hand and later chemically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The socialist drugmaker at their disposal provided some blue crystals.</seg>
<seg id="8">I think it was called Cyclone B.</seg>
<seg id="9">Or something else?</seg>
<seg id="10">But it was done successfully.</seg>
<seg id="11">Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="12">A box with a kind of juvenile anesthesiologist who carried the ants into the nest, and then he would not allow the queen to generate new offspring.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I digress.</seg>
<seg id="14">As time went on, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, I have learned from life that interfering in the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.</seg>
<seg id="16">The truth with fleas and bugs, I don't think I'd get to exacerbate the karma of killing them.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if they weren't going to be able to crawl up our necks, they would eat the flakes of decayed skin, some of those invisible eyelashes, and the like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their peaceful existence was broken by a spider.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was a common kind of trick that resided in the ceiling for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were supposed to live from the occasional mucus and mosquitoes, which only heightened comfort.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because he had lived with us for several years, we discovered that they were mainly fed, and that their numbers seemed to maintain their numbers.</seg>
<seg id="22">A confidential regular contact with each carried out we found that it was a female.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, we were seeing romantic talk with a partner about a third of the smaller, as carefully tinted on the strands of the web, so that it would not be eaten before it reached the desired excavation.</seg>
<seg id="24">It took about three days that they did not move and did not respond to our checks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Beneath the toilet bowl, where the love games were taking place, we found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.</seg>
<seg id="26">Then the spider did not move for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="27">When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging from her surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="28">They soon disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were eaten away by their mother, and they ran away.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even the female has gone missing after a week.</seg>
<seg id="31">If she went away or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.</seg>
<seg id="32">Right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that great-looking toilet.</seg>
<seg id="33">For some time from the ceiling, she watched our behavior carefully, and moved under the toilet bowl to assess our aggression as a friendship.</seg>
<seg id="34">The numbers of somewhat-hyped fish were reduced again, and the spider slowly looked at its normal activities to provide food.</seg>
<seg id="35">All year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our daughter among this has reached an age where the use of the potter has been a disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal healing of its contents has already been given to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">We picked it up more strongly to use the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="39">Her daughter, however, had found an excuse in that spider she had seen very well.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our talk of having a spider seen...... has never taken any happiness in the house.</seg>
<seg id="41">Crying and screaming, she forced her trouser.</seg>
<seg id="42">There was no other way.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was a time when a spider had to be, in the interest of a daughter's development, to command.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's all down to me.</seg>
<seg id="45">He was trapped in a glass and banished across the balcony into the garden.</seg>
<seg id="46">I used to say goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt loathe after such a long experience as if I was throwing a relative.</seg>
<seg id="47">We assumed that the fish would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply by a geometric series.</seg>
<seg id="48">Wonder, week, two, we haven't found any.</seg>
<seg id="49">I began to speculate on the cause.</seg>
<seg id="50">I wondered if there was a spider in the direction of the ants, somehow, that the bathroom environment was not as conducive to their existence as we thought.</seg>
<seg id="51">But then the first bits of midsize came, and they were bustling again.</seg>
<seg id="52">I had to think of another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link to the spider must have had a cause in that when they couldn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="53">Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance triggered some sort of alarm.</seg>
<seg id="54">It's more that I have no illusions about their eyesight.</seg>
<seg id="55">Some light plaques showed, but that they would react to waving arms or fast movements, no.</seg>
<seg id="56">My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="57">I think she's forgotten the potty.</seg>
<seg id="58">All we have to do is attract a spider.</seg>
<seg id="59">I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they haven't turned on me after the execution.</seg>
<seg id="60">Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which has enriched the world.</seg>
<seg id="2">The prophets of the genius of the last century may never have been fascinated by mankind.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was able to immerse himself so deep that the creation was always a stunning finding.</seg>
<seg id="4">Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the awareness of people has entered its special and general theory of relativity, which, so far, is best described by the universe in its gigantic proportions.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is also impossible to ignore its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantum electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no doubt that the desktop itself, and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity, is so complex for many that they prefer to become easy-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="9">But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, if he could not find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour in the vicinity of your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.</seg>
<seg id="10">I allowed myself from his entire pleads of famous quotes to pick up these ten, which literally captivated me.</seg>
<seg id="11">Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two things are endless.</seg>
<seg id="13">Space and human stupidity.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm not so sure about the first one.</seg>
<seg id="15">No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.</seg>
<seg id="16">But one could prove that I was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it's a sad time when it's easier to smash an atom than destroy prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="18">If the mess is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't know what will fight in the Third World War, but in that fourth it will be sticks and stones.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Knowing little is dangerous and knowing too much.</seg>
<seg id="22">If I had an hour to master the problem my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the world the hardest thing to understand the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the end of the day, I cannot forgive myself for failing to guide Einstein's definition of success: By taking A for success, the formula is: And = X + Y + Z, where X is a work, Y rest, and Z is to keep its mouth shut.</seg>

<seg id="1">New and modern.</seg>
<seg id="2">Hospitals in the Zlín region are expecting changes in 1.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It's a success considering that all of this year, all four are held in black numbers," said contender Stanislav Mišák.</seg>
<seg id="4">The total profit of regional facilities is about $32 million at this time.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stakes in this are mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Kron, Visy, Uhersky Hradiště and Zlín, it is due to the building, which together will cost almost £1.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long period when we were shopping mainly devices ended.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, high-tech health can't be done, the county deputy's plans for health care have been justified.</seg>
<seg id="10">He enjoys the changes at all hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The builders will come to the hospitals next year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Visy, they now select the supplier of the new internal pavilion for nearly $300 million.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Krometers, they have a scheduled port of dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Oklahoma Hradier wants to open a new intern for around 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the head of Baze's hospital awaits the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an interstate that will require three quarters of a billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">In all cases, it is crucial and often the biggest changes in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients, and doctors," she said, for example, to the construction of the hospital, the director of the hospital, Vera Proust.</seg>
<seg id="18">The five-story building is due to be done in about two years and offers comfortable amenities for the intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds, and intensive care.</seg>
<seg id="19">More comfort for patients.</seg>
<seg id="20">Changes that are significantly identified by patients will be touched by all regions.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the new buildings will be replaced by those in which, for example, there are many sufferers on one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, beds are unloaned, the windows are not tight, and the paramedics don't have adequate conditions for the job.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Our intern, for example, was built thirty-five years ago, and now he's on the edge of his life," the head of the Zola hospital, Pavel Calábek, pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="23">Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building linked to an urgent income.</seg>
<seg id="24">Doctors and patients will have all emergency departments in one place, in addition to new rooms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The same model is already half-finished by the Utah Hradier.</seg>
<seg id="26">The central income is standing by, and there will be an interstate within three years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We will pay the building from the loan and in part from our own devices," explained director Petr Sládek.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is this hospital that can afford its own funding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Profits are still highest, and there were no losses to the loss two years ago, when a House hospital was struggling with a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar loss.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we will raise revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," listed Patriot Vajas, who has the economy in charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">Patients chronicled hospitals will also be seen to improve.</seg>
<seg id="32">Within ten to fifteen years, they will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions of up to half a billion kronor.</seg>
<seg id="33">This year, the repair station will be ready, then the port of dialysis, or construction of the building for the new magnetic resonance imaging, will begin.</seg>

<seg id="1">No one has explained how I should keep the refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2">The interior minister, Milan Chovanec (ČSSD), has complained after negotiations with his European colleagues that the other states of the Czech Republic are pushing to adopt quotas for refugee redistribution, but reject any discussion.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also observes that he has not yet been told how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Can you, more specifically, describe the position you came to be at the meeting of the EU's foreign ministers and the European Union?</seg>
<seg id="6">We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that just can't function.</seg>
<seg id="7">We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.</seg>
<seg id="8">They're living creatures that have some visions, they're going somewhere, they have some relatives.</seg>
<seg id="9">We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.</seg>
<seg id="10">We can't imagine.</seg>
<seg id="11">We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, registration places, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="13">We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.</seg>
<seg id="14">But saying quotas will solve everything?</seg>
<seg id="15">We've done forty grand a little while ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.</seg>
<seg id="16">When will it be five hundred thousand?</seg>
<seg id="17">And how do we keep those people in that territory?</seg>
<seg id="18">Ninety-eight percent of all people crossing us want to go to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's almost no one for us, we just don't know how to hold them here.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have the ambition to walk by other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, they are gaining asylum on us, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, from Syria and other countries, is limited close to zero.</seg>
<seg id="21">You mentioned that the refugees don't actually want us, but fifteen hundred people have already pledged to accept.</seg>
<seg id="22">Would it not be possible to accept more of them?</seg>
<seg id="23">We have pledged to accept 1500 people, but with the condition.</seg>
<seg id="24">We said: Functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even with the 1,500, there's going to be 1100 people with whom we can deal with an asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="26">They will come into our detention facility and treat them as much as to those we have captured.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a big issue, and we will debate it with Europe if we can hold people to be registered in Italy and Greece, possibly in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because Europe is behaving in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.</seg>
<seg id="29">That means, they will come to our territory with the registrations, and if there is a deal that is not yet, it may be that we will not hold that 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after arriving.</seg>
<seg id="30">If we can restrain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them in an asylum procedure.</seg>
<seg id="31">If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent, according to European statistics, receive international protection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then they get the papers that will allow them to travel across Europe.</seg>
<seg id="33">And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then there are four hundred people who will be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's the second project that's been breaking up so far, and we've made progress only by debating the churches about the possibility that they should help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.</seg>
<seg id="36">But that's a run for a very long line.</seg>
<seg id="37">You said that at the meeting of ministers with us, the other states were unwilling to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="38">But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but offers no solidarity step that would block the debate?</seg>
<seg id="39">And what exactly does that take to be a solid step?</seg>
<seg id="40">If the Federal Republic of Germany says an incentive that all migrants from Syria can join them, the message spreads in the hours of all the camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="41">It encourages another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want us to.</seg>
<seg id="42">We think the road is to protect the external borders - just to discourage those migratory waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.</seg>
<seg id="43">To show them that they don't stand a chance.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="45">From secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="46">If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, that fifty per cent of what social-welfare systems would spend on them today could go to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to the first day that Germany had implemented the controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.</seg>
<seg id="48">Now it's eighty, the first day it was 12.</seg>
<seg id="49">Where should it go to tighten controls on the border?</seg>
<seg id="50">We were afraid of a glitch in the order of hundreds of people.</seg>
<seg id="51">These are the numbers we're managing.</seg>
<seg id="52">We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detentions.</seg>
<seg id="53">Of course, all the people we hold will return to Austria within seven days.</seg>
<seg id="54">We do it by default.</seg>
<seg id="55">The Austrians are the only ones taking these people, with Hungary it's complex and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.</seg>
<seg id="56">So where is the breaking point?</seg>
<seg id="57">Would it have to be a thousand a day?</seg>
<seg id="58">I think it would have to be a couple of hundred a day.</seg>
<seg id="59">Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacity enough to make contingency plans.</seg>
<seg id="60">Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately call an extraordinary government.</seg>
<seg id="61">He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in telephone contact a few times a day.</seg>
<seg id="62">If the situation arises, the government can sit down in force immediately, and by one resolution, it would decide to strengthen the police on the military, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.</seg>
<seg id="63">The extreme option is the state of emergency, which has now been declared in some places by Hungary?</seg>
<seg id="64">I don't think it can come this far.</seg>
<seg id="65">Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="66">I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="67">All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will attempt to divert migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then be a direct route to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.</seg>

<seg id="4">The football players were given their money.</seg>
<seg id="5">Football Slavia campaigned on Tuesday for the first time for insolvency proceedings before the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nearly three months after that, for about $20 million, she filed a proposal for Online Services from Pacific Samoa.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a matter of hours, Councillor Senator Michael Wenzil tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzil that he did not have to declare bankruptcy over Slade.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it must be said she had the arguments.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became the big Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as Czech billionaire Jiří Shimana.</seg>
<seg id="10">Obviously from new owners to the club, money has arrived at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="11">This also proves a statement by Slavie ahead of Tuesday's court hearing - the drilling club on Monday, just the day before the hearing in the trial, sent owed tens of millions of crowns.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Everything was between September 11 and 15 September," said the legal representative, Slavie Mouser.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who did Slavia pay?</seg>
<seg id="14">Current and former players and business partners.</seg>
<seg id="15">In particular, for example, the Slovak exrepresentative of Milan Ivan or the Czech bookkeeper Mariu Likud.</seg>
<seg id="16">Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenick.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Friday, the club also paid due fees to the city's Prague 10.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result, the insolvency proceedings remain de facto only claims that Slavie disputes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Either according to the club, they have not been formed at all, or are being held by lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, we are prepared to pay for these disputes.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can demonstrate by writing from the account," she told the judge's lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"All that was after maturity is paid," the Met Office said, adding that it would not be paid only to unrelated or disputed commitments.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is also certain that, in the next few days, the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.</seg>
<seg id="24">She gave Slavia for three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.</seg>
<seg id="25">In turn, there will be an appreciation of all the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision is therefore to be expected as early as November.</seg>
<seg id="27">The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on the third of November.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the decision will not fall on that meeting, but in writing after it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blank was built so that she wouldn't break.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="3">Blanca could also be made safer, says the expert.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel complex could be built to prevent two drops of earth in the Prague Stadium, the production director of Satra, which is the main projectile of the tunnel, Alexander Butovich.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said it on Wednesday night in a journalistic tour of the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it would be about half a billion kronor more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="7">The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's always a compromise between price and security.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The tunnel went down safer, but costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The conditions in the Tree were the same for him all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to come from a safer and more careful method.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If the measure was used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Blank tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.</seg>
<seg id="13">Twice, in 2008, there was a crater in Strom, in 2010, the ground fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the director of Metrolink George Whitehead, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, the Journal said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The building was worth £17 billion, according to the original intention.</seg>
<seg id="16">When we add to it the VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one-year-olds from seventeen billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">When it comes to reading the technology, the purchases of land and engineering activity, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which isn't from the 37 again until so far, Whitehead said.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedExu's profits mixed, cutting fiscal outlook for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring for the holiday of 50,000 seasonal workers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx says it expects earnings of between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates on average of 4.9 per cent, which will take effect in January-4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects profit growth over the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">The chairman of the board of directors and CEO Fred Smith said the company "demonstrated a strong performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the rival UPS company said it plans to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about as much as they hired last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended in August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted FedEx's results.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, land revenue rose 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit experienced higher income because of higher underlying rates, while profits fell in the cost of trading because of higher prices for labor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days seated at the 27-foot-long honorean mahogany table, and will decide whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Towering above them at one end of the central bank's ornamentation, the two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Chair Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the nation's economic interests above all else.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a double charge of Congress: Maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, since the Great Recession, Fed officials acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch in weaning off an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, the recent turbulence in the world's financial markets could already scare the wary Fed for adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate - and no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is obvious that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at broker Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the extent, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is already providing them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which itself is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists recently asked Blomberg to raise rates this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This would point to a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed raises rates only if policymakers make a dent in the promise that the next increase is not in sight.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rally was run by expectations that the Fed's decision to delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raise rates," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">If policymakers were to do so, "they would have to go all the way to the extreme in their programming statement, and hold financial markets for them not to panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that raising rates would reassure financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good path to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, he expected to raise rates this year despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress is needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even when job creation slowed in August, the labor market saw solid growth this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains showed signs of lifting.</seg>
<seg id="24">And even if inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the central bank, the Fed's policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, with regard to the crowding in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world began thrashing in late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record value in May as investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would pull down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the May peak.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Fed's policy makers are making the uneasy situation in the market a comprehensive calculation when an interest rate rise is counted.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In the absence of what has happened in financial markets, and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, lead researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">He now predicts he will wait for at least a month to get better control over the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which to rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The global economy's health is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint of then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow down" their monetary expansion in the market has triggered crashes around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are still more closely aligned, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the global economy's status.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets that seem disjointed with economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy making push to raise rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "despite the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials turned these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should prioritise concerns about financial stability only during the big crisis, such as the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Board of Standing Committee at the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil doesn't even come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You certainly don't want to be in a position of fear of a rate hike because markets have been upset," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be getting on top.</seg>

<seg id="2">The acceleration to 150 km / h was rejected by the House.</seg>
<seg id="3">It will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed of up to 150 km / h on selected sections of the motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, she made the decision by the House when she approached an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="5">The amendment to the Road Act now heads to the president.</seg>
<seg id="6">President Miloš Zeman has said in late April that the law allowing a stopgap-kilometre speed would be vetoed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The transport minister, Dan Jiok (a YES), has been opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built on such speed.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Tuesday, the Chiefs backed the Senate's version of the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">The approved amendment will now allow in line with the original government's proposal to increase the rate from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-wicket.</seg>
<seg id="10">The House first extended this option to the highways on which to ride in selected stretches at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate refused.</seg>
<seg id="11">The MPs have now agreed on his proposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">The senators, with the consent of the transport minister, have also removed the authority of the transport police to have the final say in the provision of local communications, which are being cared for by the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that plumbing, plumbing, or public-lighting cables could be stored lengthways below the surface of the pavement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Municipalities would thus be spared for the purchase of land.</seg>
<seg id="15">Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of owner of the property concerned.</seg>
<seg id="16">The amendment also aims to improve the protection of roads and facilitate the handling of towed vehicles to which owners do not report.</seg>
<seg id="17">The new municipalities may be able to sell towed vehicles which do not subscribe within the six-month period after notification of the departure of their owners.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities will be able to rule out transit freight traffic through their territory following the roads of others and third classes under the threat of a fine as well as for the sleeping company.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway stamps instead of existing paper, which will also be used after 1 January next year.</seg>

<seg id="5">Under the legal qualifications of the case, they face both up to ten years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">The trial is scheduled for two October days.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the state's attorney, Mansell, with the maco, caused damages of at least one million kronor, stemming from the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The applicant relies on an expert opinion.</seg>

<seg id="10">According to the indictment of the then-chief executive of the city's services, education and culture, he was ordered to address the selection of five linked firms in the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="11">When another company entered the contest to offer the lowest price, the council cancelled the competition.</seg>
<seg id="12">The order then was to entrust the city to the administrator, and only Darothore, which was assigned to the City Council, applied to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The city paid at least a million extra.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both charges were designed to ensure that Darothore was awarded the award of a public contract for the organisation of the event The welcome of the bandwagon in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and coordinated, in a coordinated manner, at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper servicer, the prosecutor writes.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, they are aware that Darothore will subsequently charge Darothore, after obtaining this contract, to charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Write-of-sale event, which will be disproportionately increased relative to the real value of the services actually provided.</seg>
<seg id="16">In three years, the company has collected more than $5 million, according to the file for the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city eventually paid just one part, roughly $1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="18">The amount paid was, according to the expert report, at least a million kronor.</seg>

<seg id="11">Then they ordered him to delete the record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Muzi thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.</seg>
<seg id="14">The AP sent a protest letter to the speaker of the Hungarian government of Zaltar Kovacs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The behavior of the policemen declared it unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not to worry that the government would destroy legally obtained material.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kovacs, citing the police report, had questioned Muzi's account of the event.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said the police only wanted the journalist to show them whether they were on some of the footage, which they said they had a right to.</seg>
<seg id="18">When they found out they weren't there, they didn't make it easy.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Dogs can bark - they're trained to deter and do a little bit of fear, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovacs says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Unpredictable Champions League.</seg>
<seg id="2">A win at City will kick us, believes Juventus</seg>
<seg id="3">"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, a corner of home City.</seg>
<seg id="4">We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a classic A-League game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neither team created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the kick was we had longer.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The cause of the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," he assessed the match Pellegrini, whose team collected in a competitive match for the long 636 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="8">That finalist last season, Juventus, was exactly the opposite of each other - after the first three rounds of the Italian League, as the defending champion, only a point, and with a score of 2: 4, is down to the 16th of the table.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This win will help us mentally, kick us in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala before the new rookie.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Manchester they represented Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is, this victory is so important, perhaps because of it we will ride a winning wave," Morata hopes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is what my players deserve.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Before our match goal, though, we could have collected at 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," he praised the corner of Allegri goalkeeper Buffon.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We've burnt a few good chances," Yayu Touré, a Booker of City, deadpanned.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to take the Champions League experience and try to get a better result next time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Good-bye, Angela, goodbye to old Germany II.</seg>
<seg id="2">Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media shake-up around is controlled by professionals.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the needs of the media and from above.</seg>
<seg id="4">And so let's stop for a little while.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, newspapers and media are full of babies bearing their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that gives rise to a man - in a European man - automatically a sense of guilt and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Well, they don't just come here for desperate children, notice the footage of the boats landing on the Greek islands, that the geeks aren't seeing them that much!</seg>
<seg id="8">And somehow, recently, images of ships headed to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades lay down thousands of young men, disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="9">Largely young black men.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there were images of Callais, where these snowmen and black men were waiting to see if they could go through the tunnel beneath La Manche.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't think he's getting it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Too much of a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when it comes to the quotas for the runaways, it somehow concedes that it's not just about unfortunate children from Syria, but also about the vacuumed - for the older: Fashionably feckless - young men.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whose mutterings look like they've just come out of a gym.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just one personal experience.</seg>
<seg id="17">This summer, on Turkish-Muslim-part of Cyprus, we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="18">No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.</seg>
<seg id="19">But no ham.</seg>
<seg id="20">And there were young black men.</seg>
<seg id="21">About thirty men and five women.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ages 15 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="23">They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes In hands, how else, smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="24">That it is a private beach is not interested and workers - Turks, Muslims! - have evidently feared them.</seg>
<seg id="25">They've taken all the chairs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who didn't lay on it and was in the sea, it was bad luck.</seg>
<seg id="27">They were dressed like an American rap movie.</seg>
<seg id="28">On top of the hat with a fingernail, white and coloured adidassic on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="29">Then they circled the local beach bar and began to feast.</seg>
<seg id="30">They put the tables around, crammed in beside the sitting snow and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to a quiet place.</seg>
<seg id="32">Incoming black people drank beer straight from the third - how in the USA?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around each other.</seg>
<seg id="33">They kept yelling at each other.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was not English, though.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then they got into a drink of wine, also straight from the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="36">They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer bathing suits, especially the young ladies - in the water screaming and yelling, mothers with children and pensioners fled in dismay, and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool or one non-black guest.</seg>
<seg id="37">They've all gone.</seg>
<seg id="38">Regardless of whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="39">The hotel staff were afraid to speak of them.</seg>
<seg id="40">The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"</seg>
<seg id="41">"Yeah," I said.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Well, they certainly didn't," said the waiter.</seg>
<seg id="43">I thought: "I know, they all had massive gold chains around the necks.</seg>
<seg id="44">And one was on his neck about a 20-centimeter massive cross from gold.</seg>
<seg id="45">And women were like gold.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Drug smugglers?" I asked.</seg>
<seg id="47">"You've seen them booed," the waiter replied.</seg>
<seg id="48">Drugs don't fit, they don't even use.</seg>
<seg id="49">They're smuggling something else entirely.</seg>
<seg id="50">So I knew what they were smuggling.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, in June 2105, it was still not that important to me.</seg>
<seg id="52">I had no idea what would follow.</seg>
<seg id="53">But the secret service and top politicians should have known it first.</seg>
<seg id="54">They don't seem to know.</seg>
<seg id="55">About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.</seg>
<seg id="56">And they go and go and go.</seg>
<seg id="57">Today, the main problem for the European Union is that totalitarian-politicised politicians, as intellectuals, and tied to them by lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="58">Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized taskforce in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not just them, also EU leaders and television, including ours.</seg>
<seg id="59">For example, recent television images on the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow television in August 1968.</seg>
<seg id="60">Of course, there were a few sluts at the station, but mostly - old German - Muslims welcomed their soulmates.</seg>
<seg id="61">For weeks, they were babbling on the news on Czech television, as, according to some research, the Germans were almost all for the arrival of emigrants.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, who was just a couple of days in Germany, he knows it's a lie like a tower.</seg>
<seg id="63">Which confirms more information.</seg>
<seg id="64">For example, famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - the Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="65">According to the statement, ARD wanted more than 50% of Germans to accept even more refugees a week ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">That also melded our television.</seg>
<seg id="67">However, they concealed what had been snapped in Germany the next day: That in an anticlimactic vote to the article it turned out that 94.5 per cent of Germans no longer wanted any immigrants - the poll involved 67 000 people.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that Chancellor Merkel in public in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts to develop a multi-cult society have totally failed."</seg>
<seg id="69">She then said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."</seg>
<seg id="70">"All efforts to live together have failed."</seg>
<seg id="71">In a country where four million Muslims live, it has failed to identify strategies that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without being integrated.</seg>
<seg id="72">But that is not the reality.</seg>
<seg id="73">The multicultural approach, when we say we just live happily alongside each other, so this approach has failed.</seg>
<seg id="74">He's completely failed.</seg>
<seg id="75">But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.</seg>
<seg id="76">It shows an escalation of events.</seg>
<seg id="77">Conflict is increasing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Euromute Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one in the Euro-parliament who reportedly does not even have a graduation - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi has said in the EU parliament that he could play a supervisor in a concentrate - as he has done before.</seg>
<seg id="79">It seems, in particular, under the impression of the recent statements by German politicians that Germany had crossed the Rubicon.</seg>
<seg id="80">Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the stats of countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.</seg>
<seg id="81">What happened to the Germans?</seg>
<seg id="82">With the rich, successful and solid Germans?</seg>
<seg id="83">Who have tried for years, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past the aggressor and the killer of millions?</seg>
<seg id="84">Are they right to say that in Germany's soul, is the devil of aggression, superiority, and violence?</seg>
<seg id="85">Did the chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, have been right, when all his strength halted the Highlanders' attempts to control the whole of the centre of Europe?</seg>
<seg id="86">When did he say that the Welsh idea would destroy Germany?</seg>
<seg id="87">I guess he should have.</seg>
<seg id="88">When they shut it down, it began preparing for World War I.</seg>
<seg id="89">The idea of the Welsh government, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in another form.</seg>
<seg id="90">After the Marxists' attempt to dominate the state, for example, with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany on the basis of ecology, for example, which was one of the main ideas of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.</seg>
<seg id="91">We'd say sunshine.</seg>
<seg id="92">Germany's elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiast seeking paradise for all, to quietly promote the old Empire and Nazi motto Our forest must live.</seg>
<seg id="93">To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something differently and better, they have fully embraced the anti-warming parties, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.</seg>
<seg id="94">And they have forgotten that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream that has seen all the Slavs as difficult vermin - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, a Jew, was a German nationalist.</seg>
<seg id="95">And, as the last statements by Schulze and German minsters show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the leader of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="96">Which must be listened to without speaking.</seg>
<seg id="97">Otherwise, woe to you!</seg>
<seg id="98">And when we say that immigrants are a very influenced group of voters, we have what we have.</seg>
<seg id="99">And, behind this, it stands as always the capital, especially the German that it suits, and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's banks and the Union.</seg>
<seg id="100">It has led the Germans into swamps of environmentalism and multicolturalism, and has brought them home and bring about millions of Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="101">Who, lured by the voices of the siren, will encounter soon on the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and start to revolt.</seg>
<seg id="102">Germany can, once again, threaten its neighbors by force, again it may be a part of its population - but, it seems, an increasingly small part - ideologically infatuated, but in the end, the reality is as it always does.</seg>
<seg id="103">Will Germany burn again?</seg>
<seg id="104">Muslim dormitories are already on fire.</seg>
<seg id="105">What will the German government do when public protests from Germans against incoming Islamists erupt?</seg>
<seg id="106">To whom Muslims will come for long living in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?</seg>
<seg id="107">What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, follow the fear of Islamization of their country?</seg>
<seg id="108">What will it do with the Germans, and with Germany, when the people who are raised loudly and publicly protest against a new Euro-oversized Muslim?</seg>
<seg id="109">Germany has just changed.</seg>
<seg id="110">The conflict that has created the promotion of sunshine ideology in Europe, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.</seg>
<seg id="111">And because of the blunt negotiations toward disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, this cannot be done well.</seg>
<seg id="112">Finish tomorrow.</seg>

<seg id="7">Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women lyrically reciprocated why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyway, on the question, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?," their answers could function as a conduit for whoever gains the heart of Bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.</seg>

<seg id="15">They are well together and pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a fine couple.</seg>
<seg id="17">For her, she claims that during his last visit home, she realised that Wood could be "the one."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had few options to start his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after its move to the United States and a lot of teams were consulted after its great start training at the end of last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches left to sit Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the convert of the Australian rugby league in the first kick off the pitch at Tuesday's 20-3 draw at Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula was also continuing to be honest in the dressing room after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of being chewed up in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also backed Hayne in public at a press conference after the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the error and take care of just another game.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has made his mistake during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne.</seg>
<seg id="11">It certainly wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fanclub had hoped for his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne was caught up in the swearing when he left the field after the error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in the NFL, he couldn't even imagine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That happens, you just focus on the next game and that's the whole thing," Hayne said</seg>
<seg id="14">Hayne compared the trappings to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal-line led to the Troika of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="15">Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hayne posted a photo of the fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the then existing legislation - even if it constituted a substitute in relation to the detached real estate - is now reaching only a fraction of the value of the property.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This cannot go to the detriment of the interveners, as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been seeking their rights at least since 1995 and which have not been able to obtain reimbursement before," Judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the CPVO had been placed on the part of the emigrants.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He has repeatedly spoken to the general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistency is not interpreted in the interests of the claimants and that the purpose of the restitution of the law of the former totalitarian state of the former totalitarian state is always achieved," the judge added.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 people killed after policemen fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal</seg>
<seg id="2">Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police gunned down rubber bullets into a mob of demonstrators against the draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupanhi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishop Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, says more than 1000 protesters gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Dhakal says police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why the rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="8">This clash was the last of the week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the group's ethnic group Madhesi say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and have eased their political clout.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by ethnic group Tharus, which demands the emergence of its own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 policemen.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province - a big step toward a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal that has been centrally managed for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Work on the new constitution has continued since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted on the provisions of the draft constitution this week, and officials said the new charter should be accepted by Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly obese diabetics, weight-loss surgery could be useful</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of losing surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery to lose weight than those who receive non-surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data takes a long time to view," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in surgery to lose weight, who wrote an editorial on the new study of JAMA surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Surgery to lose weight, bariatric surgery is used to reduce the stomach's various methods.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, which measures the relationship weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or higher suggests overweight people and people with a value above 30 are seen as obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital of Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in the treatment procedures of type-3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">Average BMI among those who underwent surgery declined according to a study from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of their fifth year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, BMI of those was not given surgical treatment of diabetes, roughly the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the drugs treated to the group, it was only up to 1 per cent for comparing diabetes and in part to only about 2 per cent of patients.</seg>
<seg id="16">Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol proved "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored patient levels of haemoglobin A1c in the blood that reflects the ongoing blood sugar in the body.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers report.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation, the average haemoglobin of A1c fell from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, this value remained at about 8 per cent in the treatment group.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fifth year, the group lost more weight compared to a group of gastrectomy (18.7 against 14.2 kg), reaching larger drops of BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and haemoglobin of A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remission diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though a new study has not shown improvements in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it's a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it states.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight really seriously after dropping the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we're waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that bind their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe is unable to accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Tibetan leader in Buddhists has called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to a study of ethics, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="5">He argued that in the current circumstances, human interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also emphasized that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was just a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you'll have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We need to limit the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of force has never solved these problems, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions on George Bush after the 9 / 11 terrorist attack and says the US "violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent path.</seg>

<seg id="1">Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation agent in the past 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The toxicology centers around the United States reported a nearly 400-percent boost from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 that polled a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicology center in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia's toxicology center, the number of living sanitizers in children under the age of 12, which were reported to the control centers of the poison, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children are getting to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some children drink sanitisation devices deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking a sanitizer for cheap fuss.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenagers reportedly mixed a sanitizer with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be drawn to the attractive scent of the device.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The kids aren't thinking about hurting them," said Lopez.</seg>
<seg id="10">A lot of the more attractive (sanitising devices) are the ones that are perfumed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The dipositions are sanitised funds with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very tempting for children.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particularly in small children, several locusts can mean alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," he told Fox 4 in Kansas City medical director of the control toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Dr. Stephen Thornton.</seg>
<seg id="15">You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey either, but people will leave these sanitised devices outside and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four loaves of sanitized reagent with the scent of strawberries in the school and was retaliated for treatment on the alert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah voiced slurred words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen and hit her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," she told CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been fatal to my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange to be sanitised funds from the reach of children.</seg>
<seg id="23">Out of alcohol poisoning, some sanitised funds were associated with death.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women died from Ontario after swallowing a sanitizer that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three students in a fourth year in northern New York were planning to poison their "evil" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room, "according to the police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claims the organisers tried to spy on him and threatens to quit the race</seg>
<seg id="2">Peeter Moody accused organiser Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy on him last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He focused on the organisers and the department of integrity Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late-scratching Lady Tatai in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidarin's positive yield on cobalt, which he couldn't explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He bit into the language on allegations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it comes out of you all at the same time," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I've said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, Moody released a bomb in his interview that the department's integrity had tried to spy on him.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will be named after the issue - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about things that are being carried out in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course, they thought I was a fraud.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they completely failed me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundra, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are also aware of this today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?</seg>
<seg id="19">Will RVL grow a pair of balls and arrange for people outside the coach's position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for this industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I really that bad for this industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people here think they do.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them something to think about.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="25">It really made me sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will push them and carry the burden on them to make decisions.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can walk away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The level of frustration the coach has increased with the long-term investigation for cobalt including Lidari and the recent scratching in it has made him feel "he could have the hours of his licence on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, described the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after being taken to the feet by a clay bandage or mud, which is against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Someone from my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">He could have had it last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have happened yesterday and it happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">It happened on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of obscenities on the day of the race, to which the organisers had already opened an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns a blow to rivals for wrestling claims</seg>
<seg id="2">Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, has criticized the footballing of his players as "setting the schedule" of two NRL favourites premiership.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trent Robinson, the Sydney Roosters coach, said the referee allowed the players Storm to "wrestle" his players during a controversial victory for team Storm in the finals qualification in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wayne Bennet, the Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly veiled mention at Strorm after his team won finals qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "parade" of rugby league and, according to him, two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestle.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the footage of his players and said they were focused on "contact."</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence as his team was criticised by two leading coaches, which can mean they have a fear of defeating from the Storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and tech in the last year, we've only put the emphasis on contact during the footy, and that has meant a turnaround for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been here for three years and he's obviously training a great team so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how such things always come at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has defied Bennett's idea of "thrilling football" and reminded his Mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember in 2010, St George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne then said he didn't really care.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that strikes him off, especially his young bookmakers with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">You would want to play that kind of football if you had this type of players available.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that view in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two bookmakers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.</seg>
<seg id="18">It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the game against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting big fights.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that there were more gates in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game ended 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, but is it exciting football?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are breaks and not score tries interesting?</seg>
<seg id="24">I think it's the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at some point.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from morning next Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland has been granted bail of £200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from yacht Solay, who came from South America through Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was seen at a meeting together charged in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though he faced a potential judgment of life for possessing cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice has defended the defence on that there was no evidence that he owned the whole quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by chance and innocently.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would escape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has a clear connection to Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia, "he said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother and stepfather of Maksimovice, together, offered bail of $200,000 for his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After reading the affidavit by both people, it is clear that the embedded bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden to them," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their efforts themselves were clearly inadequate because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrender to both an Australian and a Serbian passport, daily to report to police and will abide by the curfew from 18 in the evening to 6 a.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used phone girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures</seg>
<seg id="2">The paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to retrieve pictures of child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl while she was asleep, then volunteered for her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photographs of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl then went through and discovered that she was missing the phone and then found him in the hands of a sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police got involved and saw five photos, then the analysis computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the site using expressions to search for immoral images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then told police that his reason was "to lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted he was doing the search on the computer, but says he just wanted to pretend he was a police officer to scare the paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked for his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to him, he was doing it to lure them</seg>
<seg id="12">He claims he got mad at drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: 'When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.</seg>
<seg id="14">She saw naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was heard talking about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty to filing charges relating to accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breaking bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 of this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence lawyer Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register because he can argue that there was "no major sexual subtext in his act."</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling for October due to reports of social workers.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about the other unsolved cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was placed on the sex offenders register before the date of his judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Captain of the arsenal Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again on Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This best-case scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least another four English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in the next summer's European championship, is obviously uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then went back to the former form during the pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger says.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a wound that requires healing.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It did not concern his ankles or injuries he suffered before.</seg>
<seg id="10">This could be from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here, too, a nasty pattern emerges.</seg>
<seg id="12">The survey by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he had his game debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 league games of arsenic from a total of 157:</seg>
<seg id="14">From a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08, he was one of two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you go back through injuries, you have a vulnerable period, time you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal are starting a campaign in the A-League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to take up.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreala Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to maintain the balance and let the players who need it, exhale," says Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">While Arsenal are the clear favourite to proceed from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 games after they kept the campaign "unbeatable" last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees on Wednesday night.</seg>
<seg id="26">That was earlier this year in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learnt from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains a distant hope of leading the club to a first victory in the European Cup.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This commitment is tremendous," says Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">The arsenal never happened.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar views in various shows is striking, especially given how the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever in terms of suicides among young men within 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to address this problem, she identified Campaign Against Living miserably (CALM) of 2015 as the Year of the Much, whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help in the event of need.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 secondary school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equally for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is half a chance of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often prioritised before meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound influence on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, as one billionaire and playmaker explained recently, money really doesn't buy more happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea.</seg>
<seg id="14">None of the characters were defined by their work, but their personalities, which shone through a friendly interaction.</seg>
<seg id="15">Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16">As one Samaritan worker explained:... "my role as a listener of people who feels depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about issues.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends are one of the programmes that will arise in my memory as I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="20">He emphasizes small moments in men's friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.</seg>
<seg id="22">So if you're going to the FrendsFest hosted by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely overhauled for the occasion of the celebration.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know the difference your friendship can make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central Station from start to finish - whole 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidim and Edinburgh Cavani after shooting the goalkeeper against Malma.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in the Masters and helped PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani both scored on Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Lize Masters final comfort victory 2-0 against Malma at the Parc des Princes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria shot the gate less than four minutes after his debuts at the Masters, and this player PSG sent the French champions a victory, then threw a few chances, finally raising their lead when the Cavani shot a shot through the head in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they do not focus only on qualifying in the knock-out rounds, but to improve their journey to the quarter-finals that they have seen in each of the previous 3-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="8">But even if they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marauding ahead of the goalkeeper and later was replaced against his home team and the club in which he began his famed career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In the A-League, it's not easy to win out or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our adversaries a problem and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things we'll need to improve with the process," Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two overs more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who at home suffered a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in League One this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing was marked by both the man who sprinkled PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United, which ran last month, and showed why, when he ran on pass to Marc Verratti in defence of Malma and a beautiful finish, he sent the ball past Johan Wilanda into the far corner of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone was expecting it to trigger a grand victory for PSG, he must have been disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, has entered with 9 internationals in a basic set and five defenders and two drawn-out bookmakers were a tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from the Nikola Djurdjic missile, which only narrowly missed the far corner of Kevin Trappa's goal in the 34th minute, they did not offer much in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG themselves had been ordained for the benefit of the attack by wickets and a miserable finish that was neither good nor from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his missile arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he proved a lot more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates and it was just from his innings when Di Maria sent a curling shot that ended in the Willows gate after 52 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally came after an hour's game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent off for a line-out in the sixth goal this season after Ibrahimovic nailed him down the pitch from Maxwell's left wing.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they might gain something out of the game, and only a great save by Wilanda from the great vicinity wrecked the hope of David Luiz, and the score remained unchanged even as the goal of the shooting Ezequiel Lavezzi was unrecognised at the end of the match.</seg>
<seg id="21">Coach of the Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher over his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Qualifying matches are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="25">For them, it was a fascinating match.</seg>

<seg id="1">As the refugee crisis unravelled the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="2">An emergency flare launched by Germany is far from a European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.</seg>
<seg id="3">The European Union decided on Monday to address the problem of refugees: It will be more systematically sorting out migrants and asylum seekers once they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing for the future distribution of refugees under quotas on the basis of quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 thousand refugees, the EU's interior ministers have changed the priority.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rather than taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is ahead of the need to filter out those arriving already today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary to manage migration," it stresses in the text of the pro-government ministers on Monday in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is finding it at risk in its next major integration project.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="9">It restores border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The central power makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.</seg>
<seg id="11">As evidence, it has served already that Austria and Slovakia have joined this measure on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hungary had done so long ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">That it is a domino effect, but it also sees blind.</seg>
<seg id="16">The key question for Berlin and Paris now is the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.</seg>
<seg id="17">French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensely during a private conversation with their three colleagues in Greece, Italy and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="18">This idea is not new, but it is difficult to implement.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, they have already been registered and identified with fingerprints of two-thirds of the new arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others to keep the camps in which refugees would accumulate on its behalf.</seg>
<seg id="21">The real black hole remains Greece.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as much as arriving in Italy last year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they went through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's a huge gaping hole.</seg>
<seg id="25">Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and which is waiting for a new government, folded its hands into the lap.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has given no number or date.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The challenges facing Greece are subject to all of Europe," the EU's interior ministers agreed on a mobilization on this front on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="29">So it is going to deploy European Frontex border control teams in this country.</seg>
<seg id="30">The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen its oversight of the islands.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Appropriate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.</seg>
<seg id="32">In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.</seg>
<seg id="33">The question of the emergence of real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is coming.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new emergency situation of the Eighties, as such, has pushed the question of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, already established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande in early the year.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.</seg>
<seg id="36">They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="37">The number, but not the obligation, was retained in the text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="38">But as a political commitment.</seg>
<seg id="39">In other words, the process is interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="40">A single firm pledge includes a redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already reached in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trpišovský before the game with Braga: Finally, the real Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2">Coach Henry Trengove, at his premiership in the Championship, has been able to go through the footballers of the Liberec over the leaders of the European League to the base group, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Slovan at the introduction of the main stage of the competition will welcome the finalist of 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose her playing style.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all the nerves in the knock-out side, when every goal and every situation could take you out on the road to a mock-up group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every insurgent gate, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a double-match.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that was just a qualification," Trpeshish said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="7">Braga considers herself the top team.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.</seg>
<seg id="9">The match might just be harder to do that he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cadre that I suspect Manchester has given three goals.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's an excellent whole at the top-team level," Trpishovský said.</seg>
<seg id="11">But he doesn't see Braga as a bright favourite.</seg>
<seg id="12">I take it we're playing at home, so outsiders are definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think we have shown in the domestic competition even in the pre-rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from 11 duels this season just the opening Super Bowl in Pilsen.</seg>
<seg id="14">He believes Liberec can even impose his style on Braze.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time being uncharacteristically disciplined for them.</seg>
<seg id="16">They're playing at 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the attack phase.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," Trpishovský said.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've studied a lot in the pre-rounds, which has been very helpful, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also adapted to training.</seg>
<seg id="19">"And we certainly do, even if it's going to be very difficult to play by our notes," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Student films dominate the Sand, beginning an international festival.</seg>
<seg id="2">Over 350 authors from 51 countries have signed their works to contest the 15th annual International Festival of Students in the Sand.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four dozen of them, which the board made up of students and educators sent to the finals, will be projected from 15 to 18 October in the cinema of the Porrod.</seg>
<seg id="4">The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said a spokesman for the Jim Charbid festival.</seg>
<seg id="5">Every year, the festival has its special subject that unfolds from the festival's theme tune.</seg>
<seg id="6">This year it's a detective.</seg>
<seg id="7">The director of this year's famous evening, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film, and theatrical productions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"And of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's attention," said Chartrand.</seg>
<seg id="9">Visitors will see the selection of the most intriguing of student-making - films played, animated and documentary.</seg>
<seg id="10">Evaluating them will be an international jury, to which, for example, the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organizers of the festival as each year prepare an accompanying programme.</seg>
<seg id="12">Is Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Andrew Ruml, a professional player at didgeridoo Andrew Smeykal, the Turboshansone group Mission?, a playful band of Evil or, for example, Peter Hapk with a recap of Life on the Bar.</seg>
<seg id="13">The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first brings the alumni of the scripted film school and the holder of the prestigious award, among which he is absent from the World Press Photo 2014, John Aishbrenner.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second exhibition approaches the atmosphere that panned in Nepal following the tragic earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="16">On a beheading with the visitors arrives by cameraman and documentarian Martin Chech, mute film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sand-haired Brukner, Novotny and Hlach in the studio of sculptor John Novotny baptizing his new book 3 friends from the city of P.</seg>
<seg id="17">This year we will also remember Miroslava Onnap, patron of the FAMO in the Sand, who recently left us.</seg>
<seg id="18">Our school and the festival are his legacy to live on.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common ties as well as film crafts," the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="20">This will certainly help the forum, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time, and get a job position.</seg>
<seg id="21">The festival is associated with the emergence of the Neighborhood Higher Training School film in the Sand.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its founders, spouses of Vladan and Milos Tercha, organized their first year in 1997.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies cover clients' entitlements in full.</seg>
<seg id="2">Insurance companies should cover clients' claims in the bankruptcy of the travel agent in full.</seg>
<seg id="3">She made a decision on Wednesday by the House when she approved a revised amendment to the terms of the business in tourism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against the bankruptcy of a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the client's entitlements as well as the agreed limit do not agree.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Department for Local Development is insisting on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.</seg>
<seg id="7">Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to insurance travel agents against the crash when it comes to pay.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the proposal has been criticised by travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Without insurance, they will have to either quit or go abroad.</seg>
<seg id="10">Minister for Local Development Karla Noble (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurers have not paid full refunds are not the Eurokomformers.</seg>
<seg id="11">She pointed to this year's Constitutional Court decision, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund of the money, regardless of the insurance limit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Insurance companies will be given enough information about the management of the travel agents and will be able to determine the right limit, stressed the Sept.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.</seg>
<seg id="14">The bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Travel agents will have to end their actions or move abroad," Kalousek warned.</seg>
<seg id="16">A member of the presidents of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD), with Kalouskou's concerns on the basis of a survey among the Member CK, disagreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The statement of the insurance companies does not consider Okamura relevant; there is no official written observations in that sense.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are told, however, whether the travel agencies will consist of involvement, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="20">Before the provision was warned, John Fischer (ODS), which referred to the opinion of the rival Association of the Czech Republic, and its party colleague, Peter Bendl, who spoke of deleting the steps of the Czech travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="21">Travel agents, according to the Fischer, will not be able to negotiate insurance.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her proposal to launch the disputed passage of the House has not been approved.</seg>
<seg id="24">Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with the proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the civil code.</seg>
<seg id="25">Phil pointed to the travel agencies, which they think may be a threat to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The rapporteur, Mr Martin Berdych, (YES), in view of the Constitutional Court's verdict, withdrew its proposal, which would limit the liability of the insurance undertakings where they could not have known that the insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the news, it will not initially propose a minimum $4 million limit for travel agents offering tours of air travel, and a million-dollar limit for office selling, for example, bus tours.</seg>
<seg id="28">The border will remain at 30 per cent of planned sales from sales of tours.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the premium performance limit will need to be such that, in the event of bankruptcy, the travel agent will cover all customer claims.</seg>
<seg id="30">The standard, even after adjustments, stipulates that the travel agencies will need to re-list the travel agencies for the trip to which the tour operator organises the trip.</seg>
<seg id="31">Travel agents will have to submit to insurance companies before closing the contract, among other data on the management and number of tours.</seg>
<seg id="32">The approved amendment of the Public Accounts Committee also provides for further regular information by the insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="33">Travel agents will have to supply them each month with data on the number of passengers and sold-out tours, the total cost of the tours and the amount of advances and sales for the tours and the vouchers for them.</seg>
<seg id="34">If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agent has not complied with any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will invite it, according to the draft, or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.</seg>
<seg id="35">The amendment also has to re-edit the funding of the mountain service.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Ministry for Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will be submitted by the end of April for another year.</seg>
<seg id="37">The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, the financial plan of spending and the outlook for the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to the law-enforcement association, he hadn't figured out what would happen if the insurance company had a contract.</seg>
<seg id="39">This will not be allowed to organise and the clients who purchased the trip before the expulsion of insurance are to lose it, according to the association.</seg>
<seg id="40">In that case, the CK will suffer a significant loss, and may fail, even if its management has been in good shape.</seg>
<seg id="41">One of the ways that travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be an action for a replacement.</seg>
<seg id="42">Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and we will act only as agencies in our market, said Vice-President John Pope.</seg>
<seg id="43">The proposed amendment also includes the Institute of Banking Guarantee, but it is not sufficiently thought that it can be implemented in practice, as the Bank's guarantee cannot sound at an uncapped amount.</seg>
<seg id="44">Moreover, according to the association, the change in practice has been de facto unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="45">In a two-year horizon, the new EU directive will be required to rework the law.</seg>
<seg id="46">A total of 942 active insured travel agents are now operating in the Czech market.</seg>
<seg id="47">This year, only three CBs have ceased their operations.</seg>
<seg id="48">The country's travel agents sell overseas tours worth about $20 billion each year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Union must stand to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiations with the German country's prime ministers.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, it has again appealed to the distribution of refugees, who have already arrived in the EU, among the member countries of the twenty-eight.</seg>
<seg id="5">We need to do more to help countries where refugees are leaving, or in which they are delayed after leaving the country.</seg>

<seg id="13">There is also a need for most of the money that Germany gives to childcare, it has served just to integrate those with a chance to get asylum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt Damon bagged the diversity in film</seg>
<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, Greenlight interrupted the actor booked into a series of Brown when highlighting the need for alternative perspectives on black actors in the script.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not on the cast of the show," Damon says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shocked, Brown responded with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian came into the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown have allied themselves with joint-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finale of the show.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whatever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black character that's a hooker wrapped up by a white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">Producer of the expensive White People has championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights of directing the film; Damon retorted that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in a disagreement with a comment from Damon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the writing clip, "Matt Damon jumping into the talk of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is TAK BÍI that it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 licks since it was published.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comment comes as the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.</seg>
<seg id="14">After being killed by teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has picked up a national effect and has pushed for lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminating practices against coloured people.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, the singer-songwriter made hints at the movement while placing the nominees in the Album of the Year during the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Albums are still important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black lives, albums are still important.</seg>
<seg id="18">The most recent head of the Black Lives Matter presented a statement in response to the issue of the personality of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hateful group.</seg>

<seg id="1">"American Ninja Warrior has first winner"</seg>
<seg id="2">Professional climber and pipper Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a competition that has just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants have been able to overcome all the obstacles on the line.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the finals this season, two men have struggled into the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for more than 220 m long rope.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten took the climb first and that within the set limit and became the first contestant to overcome a sizable 4-section in the American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero surpassed it by a full three seconds and the contest won.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero provided an interview for the newsagents! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and was to know he was still in shock from winning the main prize of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac told E! In response to his win.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."</seg>
<seg id="10">Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won't receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the rules, the money belongs to whoever finishes the track fastest.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If the track participates in more contestants, the prize will be won with the best time," said Weed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even if the profits of the main prize had changed his life, Britten is happy with his performance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I don't think he's holding a grudge.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is glad to be able to achieve what he has done.</seg>
<seg id="16">He received a warm welcome from the fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's a great guy and he likes his family.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a hero to his children and a woman. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff told me: "If he was to be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.</seg>
<seg id="21">America's Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.</seg>

<seg id="26">The Tigers got three lunches in the first two shifts against a retired batsman who went into the game after more than a month's break because of inflammation of the wrist muscles.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I already felt I was going to pitch better."</seg>
<seg id="28">After he resisted the onslaught in the first inning, he released Hughes one point to second-rower Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">Two exits for the right fielder J.D. Martinez handed out Victor Martinez, who first hanged all the bases.</seg>

<seg id="33">"That put us in the kneecaps," said the manager of Twin's Paul Molitor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xi calls for opening economy to wider world</seg>
<seg id="2">It is imperative to open up the economy to the wider world for boosting growth, said President Xi Jinping's group, whose job is Tuesday's governance reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said on the 16th session of the group's central leadership group to deepen overall reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting the opening in rotating reforms will deliver new impetus and vitality, it will also provide a new scope for economic growth, Xi says.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the relaxation of border control policies, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration residency system.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement, a negative list is set to identify sectors and businesses that are off limits for investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">This system will be gradually tried and improved through test programmes.</seg>
<seg id="8">This move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also release controls on the powers that delegate to firms, and make sure the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also indicates that China will allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies funded from abroad and will provide better services to them," it says in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ensuring rights advocates practice and develop a professional judge and a prosecutor has also been discussed at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Premier Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="1">There may be a new berth in the Karlovar region.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the Deputy Governor of Karlovar County, Jakuba Pnik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and the sub-arrangements should be made on the basis of an agreement between the separate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="3">But there are also opportunities for expansion of care.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, in the surgical ward ward, there could be centres of one-day surgery, where surgical courses would be performed according to a set design, which do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">In which particular hospitals the workplace for one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Karlovy Vary, a laser centre could become a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technique on a skin condition.</seg>
<seg id="7">The concept also recommended the emergence of an apathetic centre that would take care of patients with disabilities of the brain who are in a vegetative state.</seg>
<seg id="8">Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthetist-resuscitation department.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility to the Hospital Island, where such care exists.</seg>
<seg id="10">Additional beds, which appear to be inadequate in the Karlovar region, are beds of follow-up and, in particular, the beds of the long-term (LDN), whose capacity in the Post is inadequate and, above all, should be closely related to acute care beds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Part of this facility should function as a bed of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.</seg>
<seg id="12">As she points out, beds of subsequent care are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">There, it could be used to leave buildings after centralisation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last but not least in the Karlovar region absences social-health beds focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</seg>
<seg id="15">These beds are scarce throughout the Republic, so it could serve for other counties as so-called Alzheimer's.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the recommendations, hospitals should also be prepared to implement the so-called "follow-up" beds to be released by the financial means of European subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="17">"These are beds that will be based on supespecialized care and will create room for translation of patients following surgery, for example, after cardiochirurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other surgery," the regional concept of bed care is described.</seg>
<seg id="18">New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.</seg>
