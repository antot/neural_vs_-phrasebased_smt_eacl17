this is the tent when the fed rais interest rate
growth rate will come and the bull market will falter , bond yield will rise and the economi slip into recess .
we know all of this .
what we do n't know is how much time it would take and how long it will take .
for the economi , in particular , offer a histori of the origin of the time .
the recess came after 11 month after the first increas in rate and last 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , decis in how the economi and financi asset to respond .
that is the reason whi the us central bank offici have stress so strong that investor would not be focus on when it start rais rate , but rather the trajectori , how long will it take to normal .
in the game is actual more variabl .
howev , in the end , the member can make sure that all the fuss over an increas in speed can be exagger .
`` the fed 's first increas sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as the end of an era of cheap money , ' '' he said in a note to client , julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom .
on the other hand , we do not expect a gradual return of us interest rate to more normal , but still low , creat a seismic shock that mani might be scare .
this mean that there will be advers effect .
here is a look at how they will react to certain area of the economi , on the basi of histor trend :
given what the market has experienc in the last about a month , the expect increas in rate can make the air a littl unstabl .
but as soon as the increas occur , the effect will not be so dramat .
`` it seem that there is a trend for the cessat of share for 12 to 24 month after the first increas , which again may reflect the delay in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi about what happen after the fed 's increas .
more specif , the market for the past 35 year , most often - about 14 percent - is go to rais rate in the relat flat in 250 day ( the averag growth rate of 2.6 percent ) , and then return to normal after 500 day , with the averag yield of the last six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi by bob dolla , chief equiti strategist of nuveen asset manag , publish in barron .
deutsch said that the impact on the stock tend to becom more pronounc later in the cycl of rate increas and the return is begin to decreas .
the recess is a fact of econom life , but the increas in rate often help her .
the fed is current face some of the condit that still exist , and that could precipit a recess .
the most remark is that the gross domest product close to it lowest point in the histori of the fed 's rate increas .
accord to deutsch bank was in the 118 rais rate onli twice sinc 1950 nomin gdp growth below 4.5 percent year on year .
despit the fact that , in the second quarter of 2015 , it was 3.6 percent , few expect to sustain it when it was in the third quarter to just 1.5 percent , the atlanta fed .
rais rate in this difficult econom background could be riski and could affect the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' said deutsch .
market particip were readi to the fed 's growth for the whole year and all eye turn to the meet of the feder open market committe , which was held this week and end on thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ that the fomc would be abl to approv an increas in this session , the futur trade indic onli a 25 % probabl .
`` in our studi , sinc 1950 were all zvyšovací cycl so far in the super cycl of increas leverag with gdp for the begin of the recess peak veri quick after the onset of the recoveri , '' the report say .
on the other hand , this was clear a slow recoveri from the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest of these , when the fed wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record was 35 month , we are now at 74 month and still continu .
fix incom was also volatil , becaus the market is expect a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to that experienc by the share .
the main differ is that the impact is more pronounc in bond than in stock when the fed will chang the direct of polici .
for bond , it seem that the revenu is chang direct immedi after the first cycl of increas / decreas .
at the end of the cycl of rise bond yield fall immedi , `` deutsch said .
charl schwab 's strategist believ that the increas in rate will caus approach yield between long- and short-dat bond , which match the curv .
a high yield bond often work better in this climat , even though `` we are still cautious about the tighten of the yield , '' said kathi jone , in his analysi , fix incom analyst firm in the compani of schwab .
the interest thing is that jone think that market are alreadi adapt to the expect of the fed 's polici .
`` in addit to the strength of the dollar and the declin in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adapt to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread widen and volatil has increas - all the characterist of the market , as the fed tighten polici .
general speak , compani that conduct most of their busi in the us , they win after an increas in interest rate and local product will becom more attract .
multin compani with a lot of debt , will be wors becaus of the rise dollar will make their product more expens in the global market and their debt will also be greater .
`` histori show that the '' qualiti `` stock tend to outperform dure the three month after the initi increas in rate , '' said goldman sachsv analyst in a report to client .
compani with strong balanc sheet ahead of a weak balanc sheet of ani increas in interest rate in 1994 , 1999 , 2004 , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit , as well as stock with low volatil , also overcom their counterpart of lower qualiti by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) .
debt will becom a major problem .
compani with a high percentag of variabl interest rate will lose the most , goldman said .
beyond the pure stock game benefit consum also thank to the rise dollar .
saver can also see their profit through higher yield , but expert have differ view on how long it will last .

be crank the key leav the compani to adjust twice a year .
if the yellow sticker lack a record of control , they should be in the race to explain what auditor from airbus or boe , who travel regular to check if the door are produc accord to agre rule .
the human sens but advanc technolog not yet complet replac .
on one door to the a320 is 1500 rivet .
you must manual nýtaři shake .
it take them two day .
even by the sound of hammer will know if it is a rivet proper shaken .
toler , in which they move , is minim .
rivet can appear abov the surfac of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimet .
that is rough twice the thick of a human hair .
when it come to control a number of train touch .
when the control run a finger along a row of rivet , can tell if one is out of toler .
onli then pick up the exact úchylkoměr .
flight fed befor 1989 the militari aircraft program l-39 .
but in 1991 , he made not one .
the compani had to quick find a new contract .
then , put togeth with the european aircraft manufactur airbus .
she won the tender for an emerg door for the a321 model .
courtship with boe were not so happi .
`` we were at that time for them , a small firm that did not have enough money to invest and that boe could guarante a long term stabl suppli , '' recal dubský .
the door to the american manufactur would remain close if letov in 1999 , deliv at the pragu confer of the intern aviat industri associ , the french group latecoer .
i was talk about our cooper with airbus .
the second day start negoti with the french , say dubský .
a year later she bought latecoer czech compani , and with a strong compani came new contract .
in the year 2000 , start assembl part of the door for the a320 .
three year later , the door were ad the upper deck for the a380 .
in 2006 , the compani has built a new hall for the process of composit for suppli for the boe dreamlin .
without latecoer , we did n't get ourselv to these larg contract .
mayb we do part or small part .
the partner want to guarante suppli for twenti or thirti year , explain dubský .
last year , czech latecoer achiev turnov of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of 147 million crown .
exclus posit between the supplier of aircraft manufactur is not free .
latecoer in pragu sinc 2000 has invest 1.5 billion crown .
the compani must have a qualiti certif , certif of 170 special product process and qualif card for key employe .
without them , the compani did not produc ani door to the aircraft .
to obtain the certif that manufactur process are consist with the requir of custom , and keep them in multipl check , accord to dubský is worth million of crown .
the manufactur process are chang everi year .
they are more accur and more stringent .
we have doškolovat employe , be retrofit to devic and certifi the whole process again , dubský add .
now the compani is finalis the prepar process for zinc and nickel plate , which will replac the exist cadmium harm to human health .
the award was receiv from the manufactur , but then had to adapt the technolog for the devic or chemic that are use in pragu .
peopl come from boe , will examin the concept of the entir line .
then we give them the product .
check out our laboratori .
one set of sampl to test out alon in his lab , and then compar the result with our , approach dubský way is control by custom .
reward is the pragu compani long term exclus contract .
today , with the pragu race stand or fall embraerů product .
for the a320 produc half of the total volum of the door .
replac the czech latecoer is for brazilian or european manufactur is either imposs or veri difficult .
this doe not mean , howev , that the door could say ani price .
part of the contract is the price curv .
this indic how mani door will be after ten , fifti , a hundr piec produc .
the price for a piec of still drop to a certain limit valu .
in this price formula , we need to go .
if not , we will lose busi , say dubský .
half of the hall , where they assembl electr cabinet for militari airbus a400 m , is still empti .
howev , it is a symbol of the futur .
behind the screen , it is build a new line of rivet polorobotická and fit door for the upgrad model of the a320 neo .
rivet acceler and more precis .
`` this is a trend that is mount in aviat is go , '' add dubský .
sale has a futur line secur .
airbus report that the airlin have not yet order 3278 piec of the new model of the a320 .
onli a few metr besid a line for a complet assembl of the door to the upper deck of the a380 .
it is a strateg decis of our parent compani .
the aim is to shorten the time of product and reduc cost .
the full assembl could begin within two year , say dubský .
befor that , howev , the compani must go through the qualif test requir for the instal of certain electr and electron equip in the door for the largest airbus .
the compani is bet on further develop of the product of composit materi .
in addit to the boe should also be involv in the new airbus a350 , which will compet with the american dreamlineru .
`` it is a huge credit to the compani , if they can process in addit to metal materi and composit , '' he say proud dubský .
latecoer , howev , in the czech republ is on the edg of the product capac .
letov in the area where they are locat , it is not anoth place .
befor the entri into forc of the french mother had a compani of 180 employe .
now there are 800 and within three year , there could be a hundr more .
as long as they airbus and boe compet to see how mani hundr of new aircraft , the airlin industri everi year , may not be worri about the work .
although the contract for sever year in advanc , the parent compani of the pragu latecoer was face with the threat of bankruptci .
the french group did not have enough money to loan repay in septemb .
final , latecoer was abl to communic with the main creditor .
at the end of august , a portion of the loan in exchang for share .
creditor in the compani the capit increas of 57.4 million euro share of 37.4 percent .
the compani 's debt has fallen by two third , about 180 million euro .
the second part of the financi recoveri came at the begin of septemb .
the compani has subscrib to the exist sharehold new share at 222,9 million euro .
so in total capit rais about 280 million euro .
the whole group is benefit from the grow product of the airbus and boe , who account for 85 percent of sale .
the averag growth is expect to contract by four percent a year until 2017 .
in the custom book has order for 2.6 billion euro , equival to four year of product .
the french media claim that latecoer , final , after year in the va can breath again .
the czech race in it wake is signific for the group .
contribut to the sale of the group of 16 per cent .
accord to the number of employe is the largest foreign branch of the group .
mps support a greater share of the state charg for coal .
the chang in the fee for the extract of miner has brought to the treasuri of 427 million crown more than in 2013 .
at the municip revenu is to have a neutral impact , accord to the govern , becaus the fee should be higher .
in the year befor the municip receiv from fee of around 450 million crown and the state budget of 150 million crown .
from brown coal mine communiti was about 200 million crown and the state of 66 million crown .
the amend also provid for an increas in reimburs from the mine space with the extract of a thousand crown per hectar per year .
the incom from these payment should continu to fulli belong to municip .
the minist of industri jan mládek ( čssd ) member said that thank to the municip will receiv a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crown .
the amount of mine fee will no longer determin the law , but it provid the govern with it regul .
the remuner is calcul by multipli the number of newli harvest the miner and rate for differ type of miner .
accord to the govern , is the reason for the chang , among other thing , the possibl of a flexibl respons to the current econom situat .
member of the od marek benda but warn that the fee impos by the govern may not be in line with the constitut .
accord to the minist , in this case , howev , is not a tax becaus the state charg miner , which is state properti .
the fee they receiv onli municip whose territori are affect by mine .
in the case of deep coal mine will get three quarter of the money , and a quarter of the state .
the same ratio will be even in the case of radioact rock .
part of the money that the state in fee from mine select , will be ring-fenc .
for exampl , 28 percent will have to go to repair the damag after the mine or to ensur the mine rescu servic .
the draft today criticis the opposit mps who claim in particular that will harm the municip affect by the extract of the region .
for exampl , michal kučera ( top 09 and mayor ) warn that mine compani will no longer want to sponsor the municip as befor , becaus they will pay higher fee direct to the state budget .
`` it is not possibl to seek one of the poorest region in order to improv the budget , the minist of financ , '' said david kádner ( dawn ) elect in the ústí region .
prior to the increas in unemploy in the reform parti mp warn hana aulická .
kádner and aulická unsuccess propos an amend to reject , kucera want to return the govern to work out .
in the explanatori memorandum say that accord to the mine compani , the increas in fee would not be reflect in the price of coal , becaus the price are more than 90 percent of the contract over the long term .
major consum such as power plant or power plant would not feel the price increas .
`` on the other hand , this increas the risk that the mine organis will increas payment to compens for effort to reduc it oper expens , which would essenti mean a reduct in the number of employe , '' say the govern .
it is , howev , an increas in fee from the point of view of employ viabl .
accord to the rapporteur to novel milan urbana ( čssd ) is crucial to mps befor the approv of the law knew the conclus on the updat energi concept and , most import , the govern 's decis to cap coal mine .
if the coal will also benefit the limit , then it will have an impact on revenu for the state and municip , he said .
mládkem urban doe not agre with the fact that the decis to break the limit at the bottom of the czechoslovak armi should fall until after 2020 .
the limit on the csa down , he say , should break for reason of social , nation , and due to the long term stabil of domest energi .
the time for a decis on interest rate for the us feder reserv
the whole world is watch how the us feder reserv prepar to meet for two day on wednesday and thursday to make a crucial decis on whether to rais interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
a survey of 80 economist survey by reuter found that more than half of those who think that the feder reserv will make a decis now think that they will remain dormant for some time , and will retain the interest rate in the rang of 0 to 0.25 percent .
it is a histor event , becaus he sat year have pass sinc the fed cut rate to zero .

the american economi was do relat well , there has been a recoveri in the form of ad trillion of dollar to the state bill and creat onli a low level of inflat .
howev , the fed can not ignor the less rosi global perspect .

david cameron certain know the lorax better ?
everi parent know this thing : when a child fall in love with a book , it doe n't take long befor she learn almost by heart .
howev , it may not be david cameron .
to queri the servic provid of children 's schedul to appoint the popular children 's book , the prime minist chose the lorax , fabl from dr seuss in 1971 .
it was hard to choos , cameron write in a report publish on the websit of the compani supercamp and continu : `` funni , poignant , creativ and with a strong content , so i like to read to their children , becaus it was alway an imag or a messag that i ve never seen befor . ''
well , except that in the follow paragraph , cameron report describ the book , accord to the elev from the 2012 film , which ad more charact and detail to fill the brief origin text .
`` thneed-vill in the citi surround by wall , where all of the natur ceas to exist , and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of the girl of his dream , audrey , by fulfil it desir to see a real tree , '' is a brief content of the book , which record the object of love unknown dr. seuss , whose real name was theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
as if that alon was n't enough suspici text suppli by cameron summari read like a movi , the lorax , which is locat on the internet movi databas , and begin with the word : `` in the citi , wall thneed-vill , where all of the natur ceas to exist , and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of the girl of his dream , audrey . ''
becaus he was open practic parent , it seem unlik that cameron met with the plot book , where an unnam young man learn that the local natur devast greedi , tree kácející industrialista once-read that despit the protest of the cover the lorax , crouch , kníratého creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like that relat few major pr task was an assist who had never read the lorax child 20 time in a row .
down street spokesman said that the text probabl came from the offic of cameron .
supercamp confirm that the text provid an employe of cameron , but without further comment .
adam lyth was in danger of omiss of england , but still hold
to compet with pakistan in the unit arab emir is a difficult task , but after watch the team that england has select for this tour , it will be to repeat the 3-0 defeat suffer last time in a test seri , not veri like .
i also would not rule out win direct to guest .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago , but there are good player of spin in the bat lineup , and also the collect mindset is strong ; you do not bear the scar of 2012 , onli the youth posit .
the ball is emerg spinner moeen ali and adil rashid , even though it is unknown at the level of the test seri , repres an offens option .
relat : adam lyth drop from the england team in the experienc seri and was replac by alex hale .
the decis to omit adam lytha is hard for me to analys , becaus his head coach is in yorkshir .
his seven test cost against two good attack in demand condit and simpl , but the harsh realiti is that the cricket are judg on the basi of perform .
for exampl , around the name of joe root , there were no question mark , which led to the announc , becaus - and i ve said this befor - the player are his best atribut .
a coupl of other half centuri and lyth could extend his seri , but he was in control of their own destini .
let 's hope that if he could get more run for yorkshir , there will be anoth opportun .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud , even though his perform were not entir accur , and it doe n't surpris me ; it was alway a team player .
the question of how much of the time the batsman get to show himself , it is a tough nut to crack .
lyth had seven cap - as well as sam robson befor him - while nick compton has won nine .
onli compton had a chanc at home and outsid .
the onli thing that you could gripe is that england gave the first chanc in the caribbean jonathan lyth trottovi - even though he was in the best shape - but this wast opportun is alreadi a thing of the past .
alex hale is come , and it is the batsman , whom i consid veri posit .
it 's x-factor cricket , whom we saw here in yorkshir at the begin of the season , when we get to 236 on the pitch at trent bridg , which was a littl bit .
he must be given at least the same opportun as his predecessor were , but all of this will of cours depend on the overal lineup in the unit arab emir .
the idea that moeen begin alongsid cook , who would receiv the extra spinner while retain the four quick were rais , and i have no reserv against it .
i do n't understand whi he ca n't bat strokemak and the shorter man has alreadi shown that he is a wonder cricket .
moeen may not be abl to do his job for his counti , worcestershir , but he was number 3 for them , and there is a big differ .
my former teammat justin langer first play his first 38 test befor his appear in 2001 .
immedi , he made three centuri and never look back .
zafar ansari come into the team as a backup spinner , and when i had the opportun to follow him , struck me as a veri impress young man .
peopl can look at the gross statist - an averag of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and i see it as a rowboat , but not a lot of spinnerů who rais their hand , and selektoři opt for youth .
there 's a lot to learn on this tour .
outsid the team , it seem that england has made a few chang and their smart addit to the coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawardenea , batsmen from sri lanka , as a consult for the test match can be a masterstrok .
he is one of the most beauti play guy who will bring a wealth of experi that they have experi with all the condit and all the attack .
paul collingwood come as part of a tour of white-bal and bring to the team as energi , so the ruthless spark .
i ve alway felt that he was born into the world of intern cricket , whether as a player or a coach , and just as mahela has the intellect , which can be use .
new voic in the locker room , even though they are consist voic say thing that have been said befor , they can sometim lighten and freshen up the atmospher .
collyho durham teammat ben stoke got the day off , as well as root receiv a similar break against australia , and i have no problem with that decis .
although mani disagre on it , the coach and selektoři do not creat a timet .
and you have to rememb , as the player that depend on the result of their work .
such decis can never be taken light .
brexit campaign could win if the economi start to stagnat until 2017 .
bad david cameron 's renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu is get into more troubl with everi pass day , even without the elect of jeremi 's `` it 's a yes or no ? '' corbyn to lead the labour parti , or the tuc will take on tuesday to work on the whole situat around europ .
foreign also have it corbyna and nigel farages .
a close friend of the european diplomat recent explain how europ is mire in a varieti of crise - not all of which are their fault - some member state have had enough of the british egocentr agenda , divid concess and disrupt chang to the contract that they would n't usual .
at it annual meet in brighton , the tuc has decid that they want it even if erod social protect .
we can even call it a selfi agenda of dave and georg .
the prime minist and the chancellor goe to summit or bilater meet in foreign capit , they make a pictur of a famous local monument , with or without the local dignitari , and then return home with word to win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european friend who want to nezahleděnou britain in europ - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that some shortsight minist and offici in some of the major citi have reach the point where they do n't care about our departur .
angela merkel , the german chancellor care balanc , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year , and he want to leav his post befor it will be bad for her , as was the case for too long continu thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
the frenchman françoi holland is face reelect or replac in 2017 .
also his power is wane .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern on the right side , spain on the left .
it is difficult to see how to break the leg to help the selfi briton who could better invest it energi to prevent scotland from leav the uk - which is what they want for themselv , becaus they have similar separatist tendenc .
so some of these minist may be plan deliber unhelp remark style of the snp dure the referendum campaign in 2017 in great britain in order to speed up the process of brexit , say a friend .
`` the renegoti solv the problem '' and `` britain has noth of valu out of the negoti . ''
the european to their own detriment , they know how feroci fleet street can be and how the oligarch are skeptic of the eu press baron , becaus they were inspir by toni benn dure the referendum in 1975 , which support our entri in 1973 at a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can vagu rememb the name of bori johnson , the elus euro-opportunist , who made his name as the eu 's brussel correspond `` straight banana '' at the begin of the 1990s .
despit his vaniti , ed miliband knew his enemi .
they includ a mixtur of villain default tax , foreign hackujících phone and pseudo nezámořské depart , which own most of the major newspap .
in fact , toni blair thought the same thing , but he realiz that when you are in a cage with wild gorilla , you have to throw her banana to give you to dinner , and then also to tea .
in fact , miliband was more like blair than blair himself when he said cameron 's referendové routin , sinc blair accept the principl of the eu constitut , which was sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 and earn his card dismiss .
the press never forgav him , too .
but dear jeremi corbyn , who on monday at westminst in a friend pat on the back - i told him that i must not wast time on me - seem to be in danger of accept the strategi of boycot murdoch neil kinnock , which was a mistak then and now .
it may take some time , but he need to develop a coher strategi of media engag , not with me , but i 'm sure with andrew - marr , whose chair at the bbc on sunday .
corbin 's offici posit on europ , i ll say it nice , evolv .
say he would like to stay in a reform european union .
well , most peopl outsid the violent tendenc of ukip and the wild shore of tori 's small englanderismu can certain agre on that .
the same thing , `` said hilari bemm , but not benniit '' benn on the radio and televis this week when his inner scout could n't bring himself to admit that the appoint corbynovo abrazivního mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad decis .
it remind me of the 70s , when his old father fought on tv about his loyalti , without go too far and lost his job .
match hillari was much more attract .
but the fight to stay `` in all circumst '' - bennina phrase - presum not what mcdonnel said , nor what jc said colleagu and member of their privat meet on monday even .
whatev the background of ani kind , sensit imag that corbyn want to convey - rememb , he touch me too - a disciplin report remain import in the age of the day 's televis transmiss and particular in faith , swing hotb of paranoia and betray , which are social media
cameron is fair not to provid a free ticket to europ , which would allow him to consid support the labor parti in referendové campaign for grant , as note by mcdonnel .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnellovo and corbynovo basic equivoc about eu membership - in line with the bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist histori - is no longer just a question of esoter discuss between leftist dissid , for which the narciss of small differ of the central natur of the doctrin squabbl .
just as with his equivoc on nato - tom watson is convinc that it will not want to termin the campaign jc - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to make sens of it all for their own master .
whi should pari or berlin to spend polit capit - are also suspici voter - becaus of the concess of britain , though it seem pointless ?
the unit state is alreadi quit disappoint from a `` weak perform by the british militari in iraq , libya and syria , and also in reduc the cost of conserv govern in power , as i was remind at monday 's launch of what was call the secur forum of the british influenc .

martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` the basic principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
they indic that the public might expect the agenc 's claim , howev , which is `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' are base on a detail examin of the evid and model .
in fact , this conclus come from one of the 12 peopl meet conven to develop a multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) model to synthes their view on the damag associ with differ product contain nicotin ; the result of the negoti were summaris in a research report .
mckee and capewel state that a sponsor of this meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose ceo report has previous receiv fund from british american tobacco for independ studi .
bat also approv the mandat of public health in the report on sustain , state .
one of the 12 particip in the meet said the fund from the manufactur of electron cigarett , but not the fund , which alleg obtain earlier from the tobacco compani philip morri intern , they add .
the reason for the select of member of the panel is not avail , but they contain a number of known champion of electron cigarett , some of whom also claim in the paper industri fund .
some of the other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in the fight against smoke .
howev , also took part in the meet in the tobacco .
the report creat in this group `` eloqu admit '' miss `` hard evid about the danger of most product on most of the criteria , '' wrote mckee and capewel .
howev , none of these link or restrict is not describ in the report , howev .
mckee and capewel said that claim , howev , that `` so far there is no evid that e-cigarett act as a path to smoke for children or non-smok , '' was prematur .
professor kevin fenton , director of health and wellb , howev , said that the alleg in the bmj has alreadi been answer befor .
he said : `` electron cigarett are consider less harm than smoke . ''
one of the two lifelong smoker will die becaus of their addict .
all the evid suggest that the health risk pose by electron cigarett are small in comparison , but we must continu to examin the long term effect .
phe has a clear oblig to inform the public about what the evid show , and also what do not appear , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat risk compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die from diseas relat to smoke and smoke cost the nhs £2 billion a year .
a clear emphasi on current evid - that even if e-cigarett are not without risk , they are onli a fraction of the damag caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation compet .
the bbc should end up with eastend , say former director of channel 4
the former director of channel 4 , luke johnson , said that the bbc should stop broadcast programm such as eastend and the voic , and confirm that it commerci rival would give their right arm `` '' behind hit show such as albert squar .
johnson said that the licenc fee should be use onli for program that are not recognis by anoth british televis .
the bbc was criticis for be put on public servic programm , which is like to follow onli a hand of peopl in complex broadcast time compar to his rival `` highest rate show , and on channel such as bbc4 .
after the director general toni hall said the corpor want to do more in partnership with other organis , johnson said he had unsuccess tri to contact with the bbc for six year , which he work on channel 4 .
`` i struggl with the idea that the bbc award and broadcast program that would sure have been broadcast rival without the contribut of the state , '' johnson said in the committe for communic in the upper hous , as part of the negoti on the futur of the bbc .
if you keep your licens fee , which i am not sure whether they are in the medium or long term , a good idea , it should reduc the creation of at least as far as the program that produc differ or not .
broadcast the voic in prime time , becaus they want to get the widest possibl support in the futur .
the idea that no one els would have air it , is a ridicul joke , and , of cours , absurd .
johnson said : `` i do n't understand whi a regress tax should support program that can be financ by bezpříspěvkově .
the voic is one of them , eastend , and , of cours , produc on home soil .
frank , other channel would have given them calm in his right hand .
i ca n't understand how they are public broadcast servic .
i do n't think it would not in the least weaken the bbc .
johnson , a businessman in the seri , which led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , told the bbc that they feel guilti by overhaul rate `` due to the ambit of the peopl who work here , and becaus he believ that it is the best way to ensur long term support . ''
his commentari on the most popular show on the bbc repeat that the former ceo of sky , toni ball , who use his mactaggart lectur in edinburgh in 2003 , to suggest that the bbc will sell a show like eastend .
johnson said that even the bbc hýčkanější public servic programm `` pass on bbc4 , where the audienc can be measur quit often , but it power and they can argu when they embark on their hypocrit mission justifi £4bn incom from royalti , '' but of cours we do all these obscur program that no one is watching. ``
is broadcast at a time when no one 's look at them .
with regard to the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i challeng you to find regresivnější system about who will get the best valu out of it .
of cours , we all think of 150 british pound a year is a larg sum , but for the peopl , for which there is a lot of 150 pound , i would be surpris if they paid so much , becaus it is not so much on the bbc .
the former director of sky and channel 5 , david elstein , who appear befor the committe on tuesday , said that the bbc should revis it reithovskou mission in the sens of `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he confirm that a small amount of product , the bbc has now been previous classifi as educ - it use to be 1 % of the tv product and 0.1 % on the radio - and should take as a model of public broadcast in australia and canada and chang to `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
on the subject of partnership , elstein said that the bbc should do more in area such as the prom , which was air on televis onli a hand , and to connect with the commerci report , so we could see them all onlin .
`` sonogenetika '' or control of brain cell use sound wave
this video show how sound impuls affect the direct in which the nematod .
the scientist rais worm with genet modifi neural system that can control the sound wave .
tini nematod chang direct at a time when they are affect by the acoust puls that are inaud to the human ear .
the puls are work so that they switch cell genet modifi motor neuron , which are program to respond to these ultrason wave .
relat : scientist can read and write brain activ use light
the scientist said that these worm are a great exampl of a new methodolog call sonogenetika that use ultrasound to activ the brain , heart and muscl cell and activ the outsid of the bodi .
sreekanth chalasani , a research from the salk institut in la jolla , california said to the guardian that this method could one day replac the deep brain stimul - an invas procedur , in which they are ad to the patient 's brain electrod that stimul the brain , for exampl , the method is use to treat the symptom of parkinson 's diseas .
nematod usual do not respond to the ultrasound , but chalasani found that the reaction will be when it is place in a liquid contain microscop bubbl .
how he found bubbl are amplifi by ultrason wave , which then pass through the bodi of worm .
enhanc ultrason wave oper in ion channel trp-4 , which is locat in the membran of some cell of the worm .
thank to the acoust wave , these channel open and activ the cell with which they are associ , report in the journal natur communic .
in order to be abl to control nematod use ultrason wave , chalasani genet modifi worm so that some of their motor neuron contain ion channel trp-4 .
when she use to such modifi worm ultrasound , sound wave were amplifi by mikrobublinami and transfer to the worm , which actuat the modifi motor neuron .
the new method is much like optogenetic , groundbreak tool that enabl scientist to turn on and off neuron use light .
chalasani , howev , has said that sonogenetika could have mani advantag compar to this techniqu .
unlik the light , which must be sent to the optic fibr to the desir locat in the brain , ultrason wave can penetr tissu without restrict and be sent direct to the brain .
`` we believ that if we use gene therapi and therapeut virus , we can focus on human neuron and make them temporarili sensit to ultrason signal use in clinic treatment for the treatment of neurolog diseas , '' chalasani said .
he ad that his applic would also found the method for the treatment of muscl cell and cell produc insulin .

i live in brno for quit a few decad , so i know the name of all those zastávkek by heart , so i do n't need these report , but foreign from elsewher , who are not in brno , and for which these report are primarili intend , they may be confus and may be in the final , where they arriv by mistak , then claim that the station that they had to speak , was not report at all .
perhap he should announc the select - but better anchor again - to do it again , and this time , ting with normal traffic nois and the rumbl of the engin , in which the bleat of the speaker is almost lost in the bus .

`` that 's all for now , you can go , '' said the chief audienc and began explor the paper , which had been in his hand .
at 11 : 30 , call me .
everyon in the offic were alreadi there , and the question of what , and how , they said , yeah , that would be good .

out in the antholog literati on trati ii in publish the epic
the symbol of the municip .
the pinwheel over chlumem , after year of spin again .
it is far from obvious , becaus it is locat at fifteen meter high mast .
peopl from a wide area they call him `` a fan of chlum . ''
for the communiti with 150 inhabit even becam one of the element of the municip emblem , which acquir the nativ to celebr the reunion in 2010 .
`` we ve appli at the time of the charact and the fan , we want to get into charact , of cours , he know everyon in the neighborhood , '' said mayor georg masek .
chlumské wind pump is a local technic monument .
it is also a remind of the moment : recal a time when the peopl fought on the qualiti of drink water .
the one in chlum in recent centuri has been scarc .
in 1910 , when they decid to chlumští repres for a solut , which then suit until the mid 1980s .
in the villag at the junction of číchov cave left seven meter deep well .
three year later the well complet a metal structur with a pump to pump water into the reservoir at the highest point of the villag , near the church .
`` the construct of the border , antonin fandorin think in moravia cargo 2 400 crown , '' state a commemor inscript on the ground floor of the mast .
the pump after a few repair and triumph of the windmil broke down in 1971 .
on 7 may 1973 , then began to write a new chapter in the fight for water : on this day in chlum began to serv a new pipe .
wind pump has remain onli a dysfunct municip symbol and a rariti here .
domin the run at this year 's reunion nativ .
until 2008 , the chlumští decid to wind the bike repair again and bring up and run again .
they produc a replica of the origin wheel - reduc by an averag of half a metr .
the bike was fit to the mast , the same year , howev , had to be put down .
the repli , they did not choos a suitabl materi and the wheel could not resist the wind .
then chlumska domin rest for sever year dismantl under the roof .
sinc june of this year , howev , the wheel on a tall pole again .
on the occas of the reunion nativ communiti had a replica of the wheel to adjust osadila and return him to the top of the iron tower .
but the bike draw it drink water from the well onli to spill the billabong .
and over the summer , we cut it complet , becaus there was veri littl water in the well .
it was spin at least .
`` in the autumn and then the windmil shaft from the pump in the suction basket off again , '' the mayor explain masek .
chlum is not the onli municip in the czech republ , where he receiv a windmil to the municip charact , howev , is the onli villag of it kind in the highland .
a similar element in the charact they have in honor of the local technic monument such as chvalkovicích and green mountain at vyškovsku in kuzelov jazevčí , partutovicích advertis or polici of vsetin .

when i use to build a concret apart , i soon ceas to be the sole inhabit .
the formica bathroom silverfish move in with me .
domest silverfish , insect with incomplet metamorphosi , i.e. , the transit from neprodělávající caterpillar on the bug and the cub look like an adult , but it is tini and gradual grow .
i was disgust , and i took the opportun to kill them .
first by hand , and later even chemic .

howev , it is success demolish .
later , i handl it with the pharaoh alik .
a box with a juvenalizátorem , who brought the ant in the nest , and then he would not allow the queen to generat new offspr .
but i digress .
as time went on , the insect becam the subject of my admir and i 'm increas inclin to think that they have the same right to life as we human .
moreov , i have learn from my life experi that the interfer in the ecosystem doe not lead to success and one pest can replac the other .
true in flea and bug would not exacerb your karma by kill them .
in the new resid with his partner , we agre that if we are not roach crawl on his neck to calm eat crisp renegad skin , some of these invis eyelash and so on .
their tranquil exist over time , disrupt the spider .
it was a common type of pokoutníka , who dwelt on the ceil in the long term .
we had to live with the occasion fli and mosquito , which onli increas the comfort .
becaus he live with us for a few year , we found that feed main rybenkami and that their number seem to maintain the numer state transport .
confidenti regular contact with each of the need , we found that it was a femal .
we were wit a romant courtship with a partner about a third smaller , how care play on strand of , not to be eaten befor it reach the desir copul .
it took about three day , when move , and did not respond to our check .
under the toilet bowl , where romanc is happen , we are next to the femal later found the remain of dri male .
then , the spider did n't move for week .
when we thought it was over , we were surpris by the amount of small spider hang elsewher in it surround .
soon disappear .
they were eaten by my mother , part scatter elsewher .
even the femal disappear after a week .
if she went away or pass away , we do n't know , but after a month of two , appear on the ceil .
true , slight smaller , probabl the daughter of the praobyvatelki toilet .
from the ceil for some time care observ our behaviour and shift under the toilet bowl evalu our aggress as a friendship .
the number somewhat multipli rybenek decreas again , and the spider stare at their normal activ to ensur the food .
the whole year , our ecosystem chang .
our daughter between the reach the age where the use of pot has been a disgrac .
so far we have toler it , but the etern spill it content they hate us .
we encourag her still more forc to use the toilet .
daughter , howev , she found an excus to maintain his habit in the spider , which when wipe saw veri well .
our talk about see a spider , happi in the hous have not at all .
cri and scream to enforc it pot .
was necessari .
there was a moment when he had a spider , in the interest of the evolutionari shift of daughter .
it left to me .
he was captur in a jar and banish over the balconi somewher in the garden .
i was say goodby to him as a friend , but i still felt aw after so long coexist , as if i was throw a relat .
we assum that the roach start to appear more often , and they ll multipli exponenti .
wonder of wonder , a week or two , there is no .
i start to specul on the caus .
i was wonder if there is a spider on the model of ant somehow acknowledg that the environ is not as favour for their exist , as we thought .
but then came the first piec of medium size , and never came back .
i had to come up with anoth theori about the caus of their disappear , and i figur out that their link to the spider had to be caus by the fact that when they see him , he is hidden in a differ place and that they are in danger from anywher .
or , mayb they had a telepath connect with his predat and it rapid disappear trigger a bewild respons in them .
all the more so that no illus about their vision .
some light shyness show , but that it would respond to wave their hand or sudden movement , it is n't .
daughter goe to the bathroom on a regular basi .
i think i forgot to the pot .
we onli have to attract a spider again .
i ve got their wish on the air , and i hope that never gave up on me after the execut .

the ten utter of albert einstein , which enrich the world .
a brilliant scientist of the last centuri , mankind probabl never ceas to fascin .
he was abl to dive into everyth so deep that it was alway a figment of astonish find .
albert einstein ( 1879 - 1955 ) was one of the most import scientist of all time .
first came to peopl 's awar of their special and general theori of relat , which best describ the univers in it gigant proport .
nor can we overlook his clarif fotoefektu or the idea of quantize of electromagnet field .
there is no doubt that the mere knowledg deskripc and the popular theori of relat for mani is so convolut that to elect to get a closer look rather easi comparison .
howev , it is not easi .
howev , it would not be albert einstein , even if not for this brilliant simplifi form of explan : an hour in the vicin of your lover seem a minut ; a minut in a hot oven , it seem an hour - and that is relat .
i took the liberti of his whole varieti of famous quot to choos these ten , which liter mesmer me .
intellig peopl are tri to solv problem , the genius is tri to do .
onli two thing are infinit .
the univers and human stupid .
the first one , i 'm not so sure .
no amount of experiment can never prove that i was right .
howev , the onli time he can prove that i was wrong .
but it is a sad time when it is easier to split the atom than to destroy prejudic .
if there is a mess on the tabl reflect the disarray in the mind , then what reflect an empti desk ?
i do n't know what we ll be fight in the third world war , but it will be in the fourth with stick and stone .
there are a thousand way to kill time , but there is no way to resurrect him .
few know is danger and know a lot too .
if i had an hour to tackl the problem , which would save my life , i would have spent 40 minut of his studi , 15 minut of his analysi and his solut for 5 minut .
the hardest thing in the world to the understand of the incom tax .
final , i ca n't forgiv myself not to declar the definit of einstein 's formula for success : if we take a for success , the formula : a = x + y + z , where x is work , y and z rest is to keep your mouth shut .
the new and modern .
hospit in the zlín region are chang for $ 1.5 billion .
`` it is a success , consid that the whole of this year , all four are in the black , '' said governor stanislav misak content .
the total profit of region facil at the moment is about 32 million crown .
the share are most higher reimburs from insur compani , which are equal benefici even for this year .
this realli show that after the poor year , hospit can final afford greater invest .
in kroměříž , vsetín , uherské hradiště and shepperton , thank to close to the edific , which togeth will cost near 1.5 billion crown .
a long period when we are buy more equip , is over .
now we have to begin to build new build , becaus without them , you ca n't do peak health , justifi the district deputi for health plan , petr neča .

uherské hradiště want to open the central pavilion this year to build a medic ward for rough $ 200 million .
and long overdu zlínskou baťovu hospit wait for the construct of a new central incom and intern medicin , which will requir three quarter of a billion .
in all case , it is a crucial and often the biggest chang in recent year .
`` for the whole region , patient and doctor , it is an extrem import step , '' she said , for exampl , to build a hospit director vera prousková vsetínské medic ward .
five stori tall , there has to be readi in about two year and offer comfort equip for medic and neurolog , dialysi , new ambul , bed and the intens care unit .

the new build will replac those in which , for exampl , there are mani sick peopl in one room , on the floor , they have to be just one bathroom , the bed are nepolohovatelné , leak window and the medic do not have adequ condit for the job .

nobodi explain how i had to keep the refuge in the countri , if they do n't want to live in the czech republ .
the interior minist milan volráb ( čssd ) , after negoti with their european colleagu complain that the czech republ is push other state to adopt quota for the reloc of refuge , but they reject ani discuss .
he also observ that so far no one has explain how they had alloc to keep the refuge in the czech republ , if they do n't want to live with us anyway .
`` we did n't get an answer , and that 's whi we want to make the quota were remov from the final text , '' auto told journalist .
more specif , can you describ the posit that you came to the interior and foreign minist of the european union ?
we disagre with the mandatori quota as a system that simpli wo n't work .
we ca n't talk about migrant as the bag of salt or flour .
they are live be that have some vision , go somewher , they have some relat .
we want to hear from colleagu , how we are abl to keep migrant on the territori of the member state , if redistribuovali .
we ca n't imagin it .
we did n't get an answer , and that 's whi we want to make the quota were remov from the final text .
with the other conclus - function hotspot , registrar , border protect , camp outsid europ , a trust fund for african countri and other thing , we have no problem with that .
we ve been talk about it for a year and we say that this is the way .
but to say that the quota will solv everyth ?
not so long ago we had forti thousand , now it 's a hundr and twenti thousand .
when it will be five hundr thousand ?
and how we can keep those peopl on the territori ?
nineti eight per cent of all the peopl who pass through us , he want to go to germani .
almost no one want to us , we just do n't know how to keep them here .
we have the ambit to go to other foreign , ukrainian , vietnames and other who take the czech republ as a destin countri , receiv azyli for us , but the interest of the peopl of this wave of migrat , name from syria and other countri , our race is close to zero .
you mention that the refuge do not want even to us , but we are fifteen hundr peopl have alreadi commit to accept .
would it not be possibl to accept them this way more ?
we are commit to accept 1500 peopl , but with the condit .
we said : the function hotspot , border protect , militari oper .
even in the 1500 that come 1100 peopl with whom we deal with asylum procedur .
they come to our detent facil , and we will treat them as well as to those that we pick up .
the big question , and we ll talk about it with europ , if we can detain peopl who will be regist in itali and greec , possibl in hungari .
becaus europ is act as if they are regist , they ca n't be detain .
that mean , they come to our territori with the registr , and if there is an agreement that is not yet , it may be that even the 1100 hold on the territori of the czech republ , and they again upon arriv in germani .
if we will be abl to hold them for the durat of the asylum procedur , deal with them asylum procedur .
if the citizen of syria , eritrea , and almost 98 percent , accord to the european statist receiv intern protect .
then they get the document that will allow them to travel around europ .
and i think these peopl will end up again in the target countri .
then there is the four hundr peopl who will be přesídlovat .
this is the second project , which has not yet start , and there we are onli in the fact that we are discuss with church on the possibl that they could help them find employ , hous and so on .
but it is a veri long haul .
you said that at a meet of minist in other state were not will to discuss .

if the feder republ of germani utter the incent that all migrant from syria can get to them , so the messag is spread in the hour after all the camp around europ , but also in turkey , jordan .
it encourag the next wave of migrat , which seek to germani , becaus they just do n't want to us .
we think that the journey is the protect of extern border - just to discourag the wave of migrat , to help those in need , and to decoupl econom migrant .
clear to let them know that they have a chanc .
onli in the last year to germani came fifti thousand kosovar .
from the safeti of kosovo , where we pay all the satur of the state , includ the polic , the court , the prosecutor 's offic .
if we were abl to separ them and accept them or take them onli accord to the need of the economi , it would be fifti percent of what they are today , social system in vain , could go to the refuge .
compar to the first day , when germani introduc control , the number of detaine in the czech republ .
it is now eighti , on the first day it was twelv .
where it is possibl to be tighten border control ?
we were afraid of in the order of hundr of peopl .
these are the number that we manag .
we still have a few hundr vacanc in the detent facil .
of cours , all of the peopl that we hold , we will be back within seven day of austria .
we do it by default .
the austrian are the onli one who these peopl are , with hungari , it is complic and the greek - that is a complet pointless stori .
so where is the tip point ?
it would have to be a thousand a day ?
i think it would have to be a few hundr a day .
two hundr , three hundr peopl a day two , three consecut day , we will run out of capac , so much so that conting plan will succeed .
then i agre with the prime minist , he would immedi call an emerg govern .
he is veri interest in the whole thing , we are in telephon contact sever time a day .
if the situat aros , the de facto govern can sit immedi and one resolut would have decid to reinforc the armi , the polic , the custom administr , say , or the prison servic .
the extrem option is the state of emerg , which in some place now declar hungari ?
i think it ca n't happen to us this far .
pleas note that our posit is differ , we are the nation state within europ 's schengen border onli at the airport .
i do n't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territori of the czech republ , i do n't want to dissemin the inform .
all of the inform that we have , whether from moldova , serbia , hungari , it indic that the hungarian will tri to divert the flow of migrat to croatia and slovenia , which would then impli a direct rout to austria .
the czech republ would be affect veri margin , hard at all .

at it hottest meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week establish at 27 feet long honduran mahogani tabl , and they will decid whether the time has come for almost ten year to rais a key interest rate .
tower abov them at one end of the depict of the central bank , a confer room will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that the fed chair janet l. yellen and her colleagu have put the econom interest of the nation abov all els .
the central bank has a doubl charg of congress : to maxim american job and keep the price stabl .
but sinc the great recess , the fed offici have acknowledg that there is an unwritten third term : financi stabil .
and this third term could be the x-factor in too close to the predict decis to be announc on thursday , on whether the us economi is readi to launch at the start of the unpreced stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc the end of 2008 .
although most of the data show solid growth in the economi , the recent turbul in global financi market could no longer cautious fed scare for ad to volatil by increas it benchmark feder fund rate - even for noth more than a quarter of a percentag point .
`` it is clear that the labour market and inflat will be first and foremost the most import thing to watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think just look for an excus to rais rate , increas uncertainti surround the global market alreadi provid suffici justif to wait ani longer , '' she said .
there is no consensus on what the fed doe , which in itself is the caus of nervous in the financi market .
about half of the economist survey recent by blomberg predict an increas in rate this week .
howev , financi market expect the fed will delay the matter , with a key indic of onli about 30 % chanc of an increas .
that would have point to the declin in the stock market , in the event that the fed will rais rate onli if politician make the promis that a further increas is in sight .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228,89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16 599,85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that the fed policymak hold rate steadi this week , say john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be surpris if the fed rais rate now , '' state .
if the fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to the limit in it mission statement and hold hand in financi market , forfeit to panic . ''
other expert argu that the increas in rate would reassur the financi market , becaus it would remov uncertainti about how the fed will proceed .
onli a month ago , it seem that the fed is on track to rais rate by 0.25 of a percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would confirm the strength of the econom recoveri in the us .
yellen said that dure the spring and earli summer is expect to rais rate this year , despit complaint from liber that there is a need for more econom progress .
although job creation slow in august , the labour market has experienc strong growth this year .
the unemploy rate has drop to 5.1 % in the previous month , which is the lowest in more than seven year and is close to the level that the fed consid full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and even if inflat continu to take place under the central bank 's 2 % target , the fed policymak argu that the main reason was a temporari effect of signific lower oil price .
`` the economi can cope with higher rate and need them , given the tight in the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist of pantheon macroeconom .
but the financi market around the world began to struggl at the end of last month after china devalu it currenc .
dow jone industri averag fell as much as 16 % below it record high valu in may , as investor fear that the slow chines economi drag down global growth .
the market rebound slight this month , and the dow is now onli near 10 % from the peak in may .
the fed 's policymak unsettl situat in the market add a complex calculus , when to start rais interest rate .
`` in the absenc of what happen in the financi market , and report on the weak of the chines economi in the last few week , there would be a tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research at ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now predict that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequ .
`` there is a lot of uncertainti about what impact this will have on the us economi , and they have almost no data on which they can reli on the latest develop in china , '' said olin .
the health of the global economi is not one of the main interest of the fed , so technic should not be includ in their decis make .
but in fact , the fed has becom the monetari author around the world .
the influenc of the central bank in recent year has been enorm .
the mere suggest of the then chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed would `` taper '' it monetari expans in the market , trigger spasm all over the world .
in a world where market and economi are still close link , it can be expect that fed offici are watch the develop elsewher , but also consult with other central banker and expert in order to better read the state of the global economi .
their decis make process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , said this month that `` the fed has a histori of exagger with movement in the financi market , which appear to be inconsist with the econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe , which push for an increas in rate , cite the decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
the financi crisi in asia has led the fed to reduc it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over the three session `` despit limit identifi impact on growth in the us , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici turn these cut .
the fed should prioritis financi stabil concern onli dure the great depress , such as the market meltdown of 2008 , said adam posen , a former member of the committe set rate at the bank of england .
the latest turmoil is not even close to that level , he said .
`` you do n't want to be in a situat of fear of growth rate , becaus the market are angri , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv has a dual mandat and doe not mention the financi stabil , and until that chang , i do n't think they should be at the top .

age between 15 and 30 year ago .
they went to the beach , all dress in design cloth and shoe in hand , of cours , smartphon .
it is a privat beach , is interest , and employe - the turk , muslim ! - they are clear worri .
occupi all the couch .
who was on it , and he was in the sea , he was out of luck .
they were dress as the american rapperského film .
wear a hat with a fingernail , white and colour adida shoe on his feet .
then besieg the local beach bar and began to feast .
occupi tabl around , stuf with brown and white guest seat next to the bar - read muslim and european , without ask .
mother with children fled from the dine terrac somewher .
incom indian drank beer straight from třetinek - both in the seri from the us ? ! - on the beach throw empti bottl around him .
constant shout loud at each other .
howev , it was not in english .
then they began to drink wine , straight from the bottl .
they jump into the swim pool - in design swimsuit , especi the young ladi - in the water scream and shout , mother with children and pension ran away , and for half an hour he was on the beach or in the pool , neither nečerný guest .
all disappear .
regardless of whether someon was a christian or a muslim .
the hotel staff are afraid even to talk about them .
the waiter told me in the even : `` did you see that gold , what they were wear ? ''
`` yeah , '' i said .
`` well , it certain did not have a job , '' said the waiter .
i thought : `` i know , they all had a massiv gold chain around their neck .
and one wore a six-inch or so massiv cross of gold .
and the women were like jewelri store .
`` they are drug smuggler ? '' i ask .
`` you saw how they re drink , '' the waiter said .
drug nepašují , or not .
smuggl you someth complet differ .
so for me it was clear what they were smuggl .
howev , in june , 2105 , it still was n't so import to me .
i had no idea what will happen next .
but the secret servic and senior politician should know it first .
it seem to me that they did n't know .
in europ , at the time , about 1.5 million immigr .
and they come and they go and go .
today , it turn out that the european union 's main problem is that it 's totalitarian-political-correct politician , intellectu and link them to lobbi and econom import group have the greatest power in europ .
germani and it politician - now public acknowledg the main forc in europ - they lie , lie and lie - but not onli them , as well as eu leader and televis , includ our .
for exampl , the recent televis imag of an enthusiast welcom refuge in germani are at the level of the moscow televis imag from august 1968 .
of cours , there were a few sluníčkářů at the station , but main - staroněmečtí - muslim welcom their brethren .
the long week squeal in report on czech televis , how they are , accord to some research , almost all of the german for the arriv of emigr .
howev , who was onli a few day in germani , he know that it is a lie .
which confirm more inform .
for exampl , the famous poll organ ard - czech associ of public televis compani of the feder republ of germani .
accord to the ard want a week ago , more than 50 % of german to accept more refuge .
it also meldovali our tv .
they have withheld , howev , what 's the next day in germani : that the anketním vote to the articl show that 94.5 percent of german want no more immigr - 67 000 peopl took part in the survey .
it is true that chancellor merkel public in novemb 2010 , five year ago , said : `` our effort to use multi-us veri sophist societi has fail complet . ''
then she said : `` germani give up the fight for a multicultur societi . ''
`` all the effort of such coexist complet fail . ''
in a countri where there are four million muslim , accord to her fail strategi that peopl from differ cultur background to live side by side , without have to integr . they live here with us today , and we ve been delud ourselv for a while , that will one day disappear again .
but that is not the realiti .
multicultur approach , when we say that just live happili side by side , so this approach has fail .
complet fail .
but even merkel probabl doe not have the strength to go against the power germani and europ , and especi against polit correct .
it show the escal of event .
the conflict is increas rapid .
euroněmec schulz , presid of the european parliament , the mp for the spd , the onli one who alleg held doe n't even have a high school diploma - yes , that is the one in the eu parliament , berlusconi said that he could play a guard in a concentr camp by the minut - as demonstr again .
it seem , especi in the wake of the recent statement by german politician that germani has cross the rubicon .
note that except for some , most european politician doe not support these statement , leader of countri that were victim of nazism , they are horrifi .
what happen with the german ?
with the rich , success and solid german ?
who tri for year to , at least outward , to deal with his terribl past the aggressor and killer of million ?
they are right , those who say that the devil in the soul of germani is seed aggress , superior and violenc ?
he was right , chancellor otto von bismarck , with all your might stop velkoněmců attempt to domin the entir centr of europ ?
when he said that the idea of the great german germani ?
i had .
when it was impound , she began prepar for the first world war .
the idea of velkoněmecka , who led the german and europ into two war , which cost million of live , is like to come back in a differ form .
after the attempt by the marxist to domin the state , for exampl , with the rote arme fraktion , and after the failur of the gdr , for exampl , in germani , on the basi of ecolog , which , by the way , was one of the main philosoph doctrin of nazism , she began to develop a new german ideolog .
we told the pollyanna .
the german elit has long prevent the emerg of german nation , and then left alon all the fighter against the atom , enthusiast look for a paradis for all , quiet support the old imperi and nazi slogan our les must live .
to satisfi the restless young peopl all over the world , they want to do someth differ and better , fulli opt on the side of the fighter against the warm of the planet , nuclear power plant , etc .
and forget that in this stream is also a strong anti-semit - so to speak - and antislovanský propalestinský stream of treat all slav in the difficult thing - sinc the time of karl marx , who , after the parent of a jew , he was most a german nationalist .
and also , as shown by recent statement by schulz and german ministeri open threaten respons rebelli eastern state , the idea vůdcovského germani .
to be to listen without argument .
otherwis , woe to you !
and when the mix that immigr are veri suggest group of voter , we have what we have .
and , as alway , is behind this capit , especi the german , who is comfort and who could benefit from the fact that germani and the european union over the bank actual control most of the nation of europ .
pseudovíra sluníčkářů first introduc the german to the swamp ekologismu and multiklturalismu and brought them home today and mayb even bring million of muslim .
who , lure by the voic of the siren , earli on the wall of realiti that merkel doe not want to see , and they begin to revolt .
germani can onli threaten it neighbor again forc can onc again part of it inhabit - but it seem increas smaller part - poblouznit ideolog , but eventu it catch up with the realiti , as alway .
germani will burn again ?
muslim hostel alreadi burn .
what doe the german govern and the german public protest against the incom islamist ?
who will come to help muslim live in germani for a long time , but certain not asimilovaní to take over the local custom and law ?
what doe the german govern when it came to blow natur muslim , incom islamist and german fear the islamis of their countri ?
what it will do to the german , and even with germani to pick up peopl who are loud and public to protest against the new euro-superman muslim ?
germani has just chang .
the conflict , which has caus in europ by promot sluníčkářské ideolog , which is elitist and essenti totalitarian ideolog , and their greedi bank , is grow .
and becaus of the omiss of recalcitr democrat german and all the underprivileg and rebelli eastern neighbour ca n't turn out well .

the averag bmi among those who underw surgeri , accord to a studi has fallen from 31 % to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year .
in the meantim , bmi were those who did not receiv surgic treatment of diabet , rough equal to the valu of 29 .
among patient with diabet was resolv complet oper at 36 percent and part in 28 case .
in the medic group was treat for diabet resolv complet compar with onli 1 percent , and onli part in about 2 percent of patient .
it also was the control of blood pressur , trigylceridů and `` bad '' ldl cholesterol demonstr `` general better in the surgic group , '' the author found .
the research also monitor the patient hemoglobin a1c level in the blood , which reflect the ongo blood sugar level in the bodi .
it is best to maintain haemoglobin a1c below 7 percent , the research state .
after surgeri , the averag valu of the haemoglobin a1c has drop from about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
the group treat with medic , howev , this valu has remain at about 8 percent .

in my opinion , the execut is bad .

i ca n't say that i 'm realli object .
to that end , you can turn to other journalist .

the lack of a similar view in differ show is strike , especi given how men are need to open up more desper than ever in term of suicid among young men in 15 year .
in 2013 , it was the singl largest caus of death in men age 20 to 45 year in great britain and is three time more common in men than in women .
in an effort to solv this problem , identifi the campaign against live matter ( calm ) 2015 as the year of the man , whose aim is to challeng a cultur that prevent men to seek help if necessari .
at the heart of this fight is the friendship to meet this challeng .
a recent studi of more than 2,000 high school student show symptom of depress found that , in the event that the victim had a suffici high percentag of friend with `` good mood , '' their chanc of recoveri has doubl .
similar , for those who are not depress , a circl of mental healthi friend half a chanc on the incid of mental health problem .
but the friendship to work , of cours , must be achiev as soon as possibl .
in this communic via social media , with an emphasi on style and not on the content of the communic , the immedi respons is often prefer a meaning contact .
thank to our digit live , health , more fun love and more success , even though we are in realiti rather isol .
this superfici success is control by what psychologist call the extern valu ; money , imag , social status , all at the expens of our real valu - our person desir for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health .
and as recent explain one billionair and creator of game , money realli ca n't buy greater happi .
the beauti of the show friend was the sourc of this idea for him .
none of the charact was not defin by their work , but their person that shone through friend interact .
joey 's humor and chandler 's frequent victim , while watch footbal on the comfort chair , ross 's desir for rachel , all stem from the knowledg that , yes , men can also identifi with it , although i usual keep your feel to yourself .
as a kind worker explain to me : ... `` my role as an audienc of peopl who feel depress or have suicid tendenc , i realli confirm that even the smallest friend interact can make a differ . ''
the men who contact us , often feel the inabl to communic with friend .
the old adag `` deal with it '' is strong in the sens that it will be perceiv as weak to open up about the problem .
friend are one of the program that aris in my mind when i 'm tri to offer a longer term compens mechan .
highlight the small moment in the male friendship .
as for my task , the status of an outsid on the phone to help peopl in moment of despair , but long term support must come from a closer look , from a network of friend and famili .
therefor , if you re go to frendsfest this weekend host by comedi central station , whi not take your friend for a drink in central perk , where the interior will be complet rewritten to celebr .
or if you see someon alon in starbuck , smile at him and say hello to him .
you never know what a differ it can make your friendship .
televis show `` friend '' will be broadcast on comedi central station from begin to end - all 236 episod - for # friendsfest

howev , he show a much more appropri when it came to prepar the chanc for his teammat , and it was just out of his pass , when di maria sent rotat missil , which end in wilandově goal after 52 minut .
the second goal final came after an hour of the game thank to cavanimu , the uruguayan sent the banner over the line for the sixth goal of the season after he put a pass after pass from the left wing from maxwel .
that end ani thought of malm on the possibl that they could get someth from the game , and onli an excel save from a nearbi wilanda dash the hope of david luiz and the score remain unchang , even at a time when the goal of reliev ezequiel lavezziho unaccept at the end of the game .
team malmo coach age hareid later admit that psg were a class abov his team , the norwegian said : `` our last game in the champion leagu took place in decemb of last year . ''
