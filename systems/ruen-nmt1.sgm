<seg id="1">A social card from the Ivanovo region is recognized as electronic means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="2">The amendments stipulate the preservation of the privileges on travel in the public passenger transport.</seg>
<seg id="3">On September, 24 changes of the order of organization of preferential access of citizens using the social card of the resident of Ivanovo region.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the press service of the government of Russia on Ivanovo region, changes stipulate the preservation of the privileges on travel in the public passenger transport and lead the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 Federal Law "On National Payment System."</seg>
<seg id="5">In this case, the social card from the Ivanovo region is recognized as electronic means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the terms of its application change.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, the deposit limit is set now not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, during the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now owners of the social card will have to track not the amount of the remaining trips, but the rest of the money.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cost of preferential fare for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare operated by the carrier.</seg>
<seg id="10">The remaining half of the fare will be reimbursed by the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">The rate of replenishment of the social card is still the same - in the period from 24 numbers of the previous month to 23 the current month.</seg>
<seg id="12">A new setting on the social map will have a number of advantages.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thus, there is a possibility to conduct a detailed account of expenditure of money on social card with accuracy up to kopecks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, there is a possibility of returning the numerical but unspent money.</seg>
<seg id="15">We also add that a scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent as now half of the fare is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount will be reimbursed to the carrier of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">No commission will be charged for a cash deposit.</seg>
<seg id="17">In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, reported that in 2014, there were more than 33 million journeys using the social card, in 2015-16 - nearly 25 million journeys.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are more than 470 million rubles to provide preferential accommodation for citizens with the use of the social card.</seg>
<seg id="19">As of September 1, the amount of reimbursement for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.</seg>

<seg id="1">During call to 911 teacher admits killing girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">During the call in 911, almost without droopsy school teacher Shannon Gilbert told police he shot his girlfriend and what needed staff who would come to his home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Det stressed that the house has "pödk," which is alive, but is probably upset, and said the contacts of family members of the dead can be found in her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note carelessly written off his hands on a white sheet of lynched paper: "I am very sorry I would like to keep me all back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to representatives of the body signed by Travis cloke.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nothing indicated that Fiorina, who ran two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel 300 miles into a university campus where police believe he shot all respected teacher of the story of Itana Schmidt on the doorstep of his cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="6">San Francisco police chief Linn Bayford said staff at the university learned of the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was reported to have made the true call in 911 shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, the victims will be more than dead, once the police have surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day after the shooting at the training facility forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officers were still trying to fold into one picture of the motive, prompting the lampoon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped produce a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">The students said they were looking forward to his classes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gotye, where Prentiss died, reported that there were no charges of violence or criminal cases.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself included a lampoon in his writing book, in which he expressed his appreciation for "wonderful people" with whom he crossed into his teaching life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both of them taught at the faculty of social sciences and history, which numbers 17 teachers, and many students have attended lectures of both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time there were some preconditions for occurrence of problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">One student who spoke well about Lambe, Brandon Brody, reported that he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the school year 2014-15 told him about how he struggled with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Previously, Alabama asked the University of Delaware to grant him a holiday on the disease, saying he had some health problems.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in university rules of reception meant that the doctor's degree on which he had worked so hard would not have guaranteed him an automatic job for a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="21">The university's president, William Laford, said he knew nothing about the conflict between Travis and Sheen, but "obviously Mr Lambert had something on his mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that could no longer be answered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Police attacked the lamba after his escape from campus when he headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he was able to be arrested, McCoole was shot and killed by a 38-caliber handgun in the back yard of the house, one mile south of his parents" home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, told coroner Washington methyl Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His vehicle was still standing on the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not clear why he came to this house, though, according to Johnson, he believed he was aware of the people living there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hughgrown grew up in those edges.</seg>
<seg id="28">Fiorina started working at the university, which numbers 3,500 students in a city with a population of around 12,000, in 2009, and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a PhD in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Paul's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.</seg>
<seg id="31">Karl Hairyston told me that she was 15, and I was 20 years old when they were introduced in common friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were learning in senior grades and he was a cool guy tried, who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls taunted when he was near," says Heather, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Braddon.</seg>
<seg id="35">And Prentiss, for the moment of events, seemed to have met for a while.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the call to the 911 call, he said, "I killed my wife" but a recording of their marriage registration is missing.</seg>
<seg id="37">The pair had a dog named Lythning who lived with them at Gotye in a brick house whose flip side goes to the Channel.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said with the dog all right.</seg>
<seg id="39">The former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter now aged 19.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said about her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Stin said he did not meet with Travis but heard from his daughter, Ebigel, that Whitney was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gilbert met Prentiss when he and Ebigeyl both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Then they were together playing from time to time at the concerts.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Stone told his daughter to write music and sings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Schaffer, a bartender and a program coordinator of entertainment programmes in the dim area of The Julep Room in the foothills of Gotye, said he had last seen the lamour and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when he finished playing guitar and lipstick for a few visitors.</seg>
<seg id="48">Nothing suspicious was observed.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We had fun and had fun at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the sense that they were both very witty.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, who died as a teacher, was carrying out seminars for the first students and specialized in Native American history and colonial America," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student fraternity and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">At the campus of the State University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial ceremony of the candlelight vigil.</seg>
<seg id="56">Sheen's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students back," Laford said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is gone.</seg>
<seg id="60">Today is the day of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenwich, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.</seg>
<seg id="63">The footage has been edited in relation to a statement by the police that the call of the lamam entered a service 911 after the murder of Sheen, as well as due to the fact that although Matthews and spoke about Prentiss as saying to his wife when calling 911, information about whether they were involved in the marriage was not confirmed.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll numbers that show Donald Trump is not joking</seg>
<seg id="2">Some tried to hang on him as a puller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others shied away from him, recreating himself as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some require a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, as any Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high standing in the polls, they have failed (so far).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously ask what it means for a maiden estate in terms of chances to get the nomination.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this means Trump has the chance to nominate the Republican Party.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry succumbed to his precursor to the growing popularity of Herman Kane, none of which has won and one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would fall into a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like America's "supercommittee of political actors" Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "The Growth Club" acknowledge Trump's unrelenting power and begin to deliver their dollars to overshoot him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some poll numbers that are said to be real estate magnate - not just the interim phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's ratings of sympathy for Trump have stepped up at 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Directly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University revealed that only two of the top 10 Republicans have positively treated this property tycoon in real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six of the top 10 Republicans have a positive attitude to Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And all these indicators compete at the top of the initial stages.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are going to apply to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of the GOP vote would have arranged Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either treated "with admiration" or with "satisfaction" if Trump became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would have been "upset" if he became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would treat "the delight" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next one on the level of delight?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "upset" if plain-blower Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump is massively criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent leaning towards Republican voters across the country think that the magnate fit the temperament for being president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll showed on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same figure figures prominently on the nation's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44 per cent think he is not the man who can be effective in the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Gay Republicans get used to that thought.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they wear their hats by connoisseurs, GOP voters think Trump is in earnest.</seg>
<seg id="34">Asked who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's no longer the case when four of the 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: The GOP voters had previously not had the right magical crystal.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the same time in the past cycle cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible Mitt Romney candidate.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it shows that a lot of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as compelling.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans would rally round another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some economists point out that such disparity is more likely to play to Trump's advantage, and simultaneously unsupported Trump is evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical contest "one on one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="42">He outscored Carli Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Keisich and Chris Christie on 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">He has a draw with Toby Kledge.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate to do it?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson racked up a businessman for a total of 19 points in a hypothetical competition "one to one."</seg>
<seg id="46">Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they have passed away.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he's never going to change.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, Trump's most tense competition at the moment is with knee outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have passed away are more likely to choose Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his speech opening campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most urgent in conversations in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some worry that Trump's callousness heaps key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So as far as immigration draws universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain on the same position.</seg>
<seg id="56">The government's frustration is gaining new momentum.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support for about half of Republican voters, mostly because of their status as outsiders.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday a new ABC/Post poll claim they rather want a political outsider than a man with an experience in government.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also offended by Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by congressional action in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."</seg>

<seg id="2">After Mr Corbyn's election his debut at a session of questions to the Prime Minister is expected with a great look</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be on a session of Prime Minister's Questions, for the first time by merited by forces with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will address the first of six allotted questions in the afternoon; his performance is likely to be closely watched by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.</seg>
<seg id="5">He issued a call for "less theater and more facts" at a weekly demonstration speech.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stated that he might miss some meetings, leaving them to their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will happen after the appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual trade union Congress on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of Conservative members of Parliament and became the topic of several advanced papers in the papers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the state anthem caught the attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in honourable silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his conviction for the need for the abolition of the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to play in Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on the issues of economy, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth member of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political divisions are also "digging in foot" in Labour's party after appointing Mr Corbyn to a post in the European Union and limits the government's compensation scheme.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbin told the trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of limitations on the whole.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said the party had "full clarity" on the account of what it was in opposition to only the government's plans to cut the upper limit from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will become Labour's fifth leader, with whom David Cameron will meet the "courier's box" over the past decade since becoming leader of the Conservative party.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, claims he has "attracted collective resources" to roll out the ideas of issues to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Parliament member from the Ilington County District Court said the Prime Minister's questions cause excessive confrontation and that he will refrain from witty answers and exchange of quirks, instead pledged to focus on serious issues like poverty, inequality and the challenges of youth.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said Angela Igl, the minister of economics at the shadow cabinet, would replace him on the issues of the prime minister when he would be absent - for example, when Mr Cameron is overseas.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the word at the opportunity, saying that he had applied to the speaker of the House of State Jr. Berkshire to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">Becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron announced he wanted to walk away from the political style of "yarder ballaghan," often associated with a procedure by the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that it failed him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has turned into a caricature and demands major reforms.</seg>

<seg id="2">The pound rose amid wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to a proposal to buy SABMiller.</seg>
<seg id="3">From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009, and has been met as a transfer to earlier forecasts for potential growth of quotations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sterling rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar and was $1,5505, and at 0.84 per cent against the euro, amounting to €1.3730.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 at 1.49%.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the general background, SABMiller's shares rose by 20% thanks to a takeover offer from rival AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world by collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Burberry shares edged up 0.9 per cent on the back of an encouraging news from rival group merchandise group Richemont.</seg>
<seg id="10">Richemont's latest sales figures have surged on all expectations and showed sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have again started to rise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shares of Glencore rose 5 per cent after the mining giant announced it had managed to gain $2.5 billion by placing shares, which had been made under a debt reduction strategy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash launches a campaign on the initiative from below to combat Aldi</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi lawsuit in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">The wholesale food supplier on the initiative from bottom has launched a campaign to protect the market share of retailers IGA in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million acquisition of Aldi.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of its 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, supermarkets Metcash and IGA strengthens the relationship with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in the leading media and social networks and at the Adelaide Show brands.</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaigns are being joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream maker Simmo's of Dansborough, which offers tasting at the IGA stores, and shop owners selling off the discount to regular customers tickets to the South Australia Football League matches.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - a day when this wholesale supplier of food, liquor and household goods will spend its annual day investor strategies.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake, since in South Australia and Western Australia stores under the brand IGA make up almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for the IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in Utah and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 percent in eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will roll out 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, picking up sales at all present players, but mainly by independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report this week, Tom Cirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">The forecast is based on assumptions that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, producing sales of 500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">Metcash's loss of revenue and sales volumes at a high level of constant costs could cost the company about 13 million of revenues before interest and taxes, Mr Kirat said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that's when a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.</seg>
<seg id="14">At Morgan Stanley, Metcash sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, up 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's stake in the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week's leading stock manager, Heather Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, spotted the present at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could have a high probability of disappear over the course of a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr Douglas's comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is alleged that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">The share of IGA on the market has declined since 2010 from 18 to 14 percent, and Metcash's revenues from business in the food sector, which the company supplies around 1200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational deleverage, and due to pressure on sales and profitability.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the company does not end up spending more than $150 million annually for equalising retail prices with the prices of Coles and Woolworths on a thousand-mile weekly and helping the IGA retailers in the rearrangement of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding product range and a wider selection of branded food.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the price tag and re-equipment of shopping areas is gaining momentum and hopes the company will succeed in increasing net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia president Steve Hili</seg>
<seg id="2">Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves a pope rather than criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kyrgios and for his behaviour deserves a pope more than critics, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Hili.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, a junior in a talented duo and often called "Special KS," unwittingly proved to be in the limelight because of the shameful skirmish of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon after, during a hot qualifying match in the Cincinnati judge on the embroidery had to twice dispel Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona, with Harrison declared: "The Wanderer should have laid on the shovel of Kyrgios, and I have to lay on the shovel of this guy."</seg>
<seg id="6">C, as Kokkinakis last saw a wrecking rocket after cramming into his leg rescued by Rishara Gasquet from a possible defeat at US Open, Hili precept shields Kokkinakis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Frost for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic is in solitary discharge in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am extremely worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into the conflict," Hili said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He really broke the missile when he had a foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break a rocket when collapsing hopes and I know Tanashi good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in fact he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations at US, with Harrison and so on and I'm sure he deserves credibility.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is surrounded by a great team, he has a beautiful family, and I just think that he has done something wrong with him.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he has a lot of work, perfectly fits into the team, he never had any problems with the other players, his respect outside the crown, he's intensely trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very determined and developed young man and I think it should be appreciated by the merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hili also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for the sake of an important match beginning on Friday, believing "mutual consent" is the right way out for everyone, but calculated that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all we want the team to fully focus on the match rather than the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Hili said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick has scored the power very quickly, which is proving people like Federer and Marrap, he's growing up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions and necessary, I believe, bring him out of the spotlight for some time so he can reflect on them and that's best for the team and best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Migrant crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">By announcing an emergency, Hungary on Tuesday shut down the border with Serbia on the southern border and deters those trying to penetrate the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the border there were unrest - hundreds of migrants were buried on the border area, which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stuck on an indefinite time on the road between the checkpoints of two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home have broken up tents and grounded out on this terrain.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the discontent was mounting.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the police helicopter circled them over them, migrants shouted "Down the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police special.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some in protest refused food and water.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister announced an "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">Serbia wants to be part of a solution to the problem, not collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dachich in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The unrest at the Hungarian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a general immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers agreed to bear common responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and have expressed hope that future (next month or by the end of the year) will be reached by an agreement under which states - EU members will accept another 120,000 refugees - including refugees from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to gather next week an emergency EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, does not hope for swift action by Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Declared on Tuesday a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to action against the crisis, allowing them to overturn the roads and speed up court cases for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijbright said his country was planning also to take a fence from a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to shut down the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said even prisoners were connected to urgent work on completion of a fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Over the past few months, Hungary has been a major "bottleneck" and a point of crossing the EU's borders for migrants, many of whom are refugees - the victims of the wars in Syria and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most arrivals in the country are economic migrants, seeking more welfare and not refugees - the victims of military action, which are entitled to protection, and this view will sharply diverge from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which joined Hungary into force at midnight, are thought to be now a crime of crossing or damage to a 4-metre (13-foot) fence from a barbed wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and includes longer jail terms for the accused in human trafficking.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovach said in the southern city of Seged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are clearly giving it clear: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Formally parliament still has to sanction the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border for several days are watching the presence of armed to the teeth of servicemen with vehicles and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dern Bakondi, an adviser to the National Security Agency, reported to the authorized bodies of 45 people attempting to cross the border, at the border, and another 15 people inside the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They have crossed the border, having broken the fence, are currently under police guard and are accused of carrying out administrative violations under new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are quick to recover the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes along the border with Serbia, fit to block one of the aisles of a rail car, winding up a barbed wire.</seg>
<seg id="28">The unrest broke out at the main pro-crossing across the border near the town of Raleosk (Hungary), as Hungarians posted an emergency room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break inside.</seg>
<seg id="29">The passage inside was managed by about 20 persons, with thousands of people being left outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and refused food and water until they were missed in Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halves in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democrats' race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has support in 47 percent among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent) and Sanders goes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In more than five months before the electoral rivalry began, most Democratic voters are saying it is too early to say that they have defined themselves with the candidate who will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clinton supporters are more confident than supporting other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since last month's CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has dwindled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its support among men has substantially fallen and Sanders is lagging behind it by just 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">The preference given to Clinton by the Democrats for up to 50 years is gone, and they are with Sanders now on equal footing.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton still has a big advantage among more senior voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton trailed Sanderes by a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has an edge in five points in that group.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nearly half of Democrats across the country said they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and a further 15 percent would support her only because she's a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six per cent would not support her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her account.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among those at the moment do not support Clinton, the view is more controversial - only about a quarter enthusiastically backing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the smaller number of Republican presidential candidates say the same about their lead, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton supporters set an open question as to why they want to see the candidate her, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then - that now the time of the female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Also, Clinton supporters talk about an association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also called agreed not on the issues and odds of electing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the vice president is voicing a potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - though a third believe he shouldn't be.</seg>
<seg id="23">When asked if they wanted to see a second seat among the party's candidates, the GOP Democrats in most cases called Biden.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters more than half say they would have chosen Biden a second, that's more than Sanders did.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to show his candidacy for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Bayern among the race to 30 points without him.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democrat voters see Clinton a candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that rate, Biden was a standout in second place, but the percentage of those who regard him as the most likely candidate has increased.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, when asked what is most important in the candidate, the GOP voters choose other options beyond the chances of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similarly to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an uninvited nominee for these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from his party.</seg>
<seg id="31">Most consider Clinton, Sandersa and Biden to be honest and credible by people with good leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden is out of all three leads by honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't consider Clinton fair and credible, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanderes (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have a certain view of it on that score.</seg>
<seg id="34">The GOP's primary electorates also generally consider Clinton's similar ideological views, Sandersa and Biden.</seg>
<seg id="35">By all these measures, about a quarter of Democrats have no opinion about Sanderse.</seg>
<seg id="36">While the questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email server and Hillary Clinton's office are continuing, most of the Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation on this account and believe that this did not affect their overall opinion of her.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a very different story from the American public in general.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, but satisfied with just about a third.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was divided even in March, shortly after the story became known.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say that the controversy over the email has not influenced their overall opinion on Clinton, though 36 percent say their view of her has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim their views on Clinton have deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton considers fair and credible voters from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: Only 32 percent think of her fair and credible, eight points lower compared to last month, and by 15 compared with the maths.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not view its fair and credible.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not view Trump as fair and credible.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks on leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six contested Biden candidates, Carson and Bush show a better result on honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">Most see in Sanderse a more honest person than not, but, as about Carsone, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for a sample of 351 of the Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="6">The poll also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups, sweating Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasich, stepped back together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Hackabi and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio together take third place with 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="9">The limit of error for a selection of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.</seg>
<seg id="10">A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls - showing support for 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly outpacing Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to the growing support of Carson last week, Trump made a number of critical hits in the address of a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of first-degree Baruch College student</seg>
<seg id="2">About two years later, after the death of a college student during a ritual dedicated to a fraternity in Pokono Mountain in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was raised against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The members of the brother-in-law Pi Delta Psi of New York College Baruch brutally attacked Chan's "Michael" Denga during a ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him back to hospital that caused his death," police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials say a student with a blindfolded and 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times pushed while he was trying to reach a goal by going on the slippery surface.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Harper eventually complained that he had a sore head and then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fraternity members Pi Delta Psi did not call 911 when the intruder lost consciousness, and waited for an alleged hour before delivering him to hospital, police said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did, however, find time to change Denga's clothing, find in Guridge his symptoms and contact Andy Mengh, the fraternity's national president, to ask the council, as police chief Chris Wagner said in a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members of the fraternity began hiding the personal possessions, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Denga," said shaker Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was unable to save and he died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the autopsy report, Fury has received several blunt head injuries, tweets and hips.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have suffered as a result of the rituals of dedication to the fraternity, because at least one student dies during them every year, starting in 1970," said a statement by Douglas Faerberg, a lawyer representing the family foundation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step by the authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jury County Monroe bowed in favor of the murder charge of a third degree for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other members, including Mr Menga, will be given the charge of domestic violence and criminal collusion.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organisation that has authorized all of this or unofficially both," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch College banned the fraternity and the nationwide fraternity excluded from its structure the local branch.</seg>

<seg id="1">What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be a rate hike, and "the bull market" is stumbling, bond yields will rise, and the economy falls into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">That we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long it will take until this time, and how long that will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">Specific to the economy, history shows little about time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for the whole 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why the administration of the US Central Bank has so insistently emphasised that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates, but on how much adjustment will take.</seg>
<seg id="9">Indeed, there are many variables in the game.</seg>
<seg id="10">After all, however, market participants may find that all fuss around raising rates is exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of an era of "cheap money,"" said Julian Jessop, chief specialist at the international economy at Capital Economics, in a statement to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">That does not mean, however, that the consequences will not.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might react, depending on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen over the last month or so, waiting for a rate hike could lead to instability for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">When raising rates, however, the consequences are usually not that dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It does not seem that the proceeds of the shares are based on 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of the results of the Federal Reserve rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">If more concretely, the market for the last roughly 35 years is more likely to change sharply - about 14 percent - in the direction of rate hikes - remains fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, at the rate of 500 days, returns to a normal state with an average yield of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Long, a principal trading analyst at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said that the result for securities tends not to be more pronounced at the rate of rate hikes, and earnings from stocks are beginning to decline.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often play by them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and can precipitate recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Basically, gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point in the lifetime of an increased rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of the rate increase since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was below 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few believe that this is for a long time when it holds only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "will this time differently," reported Deutsche.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants are preparing to raise rates for the Federal Reserve all year round, with their view drawn up by the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">As long as many experts on strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, the futures trade speaks only about a 25-cent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes before today were in the supercycle of an increased fiscal lever under GDP, overlapping of the peaks before recession, very quickly after recovery," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle at the moment - the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months; it only lasts for 74 months and is not over yet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income has also become volatile while the market is expecting a rate hike, and this scenario is somewhat like the one that is being implemented for the shares.</seg>
<seg id="32">The principal difference is that there will be an effect in the bonds than for shares when the Federal system changes its strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of bonds, it seems that yields change the vector immediately after the first increase / reduction of rates in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of rising rates, bond yields are immediately falling," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe a rate rise will result in the rates of long-term and short-term bond yields close, making the curve more flat.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we still fear fluctuations in returns," according to the study of Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes markets have already adapted to the expected outcome of Fed policy.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations there are signs that the market has been rigged towards the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is more flat, the credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market in tightening the policy of the Federal System.</seg>
<seg id="40">Speaking in general, companies leading the core of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates, and local production will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">International companies with many debts will be worse off as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive - financially.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that "quality" shares demonstrate efficiencies above the market in the three months after the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs' analysts in a report for customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a stable financial condition cost the company an unstable condition on the results of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, at an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital ratios and stocks with low volatility also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will be a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Aside from purely exchange-traded deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Depositors could see profit also through higher returns, though experts diverge in how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="1">"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM," claims member of parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">MP Andrew Bingham's parliament slams the station for "cutting standards"</seg>
<seg id="3">Proves it becomes increasingly different from commercial rival</seg>
<seg id="4">Also targeting the BBC Music Awards, saying the premium is just soda off the Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">A colleague of parliament Damien Collins, who crashed on The Voice with as much criticism, was not original</seg>
<seg id="6">"BBC Radio 3 is transformed into Classic FM."</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of parliament from the Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC's leadership that it seems as if a public radio station is "foolish" and becomes increasingly different from its commercial rival.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to me I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you try to do something different - here are two examples that first came to me in mind, in which you actually only copy what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The BBC director has rejected the allegations, claiming BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and education audiences.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fact that I learn from Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anymore.</seg>
<seg id="14">And his devotion to live performance and making music really doesn't compare any more to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Also really very important, I think the Radio 3 interest is in the search for new music and in promoting new works," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager Alan Dave argued that radio stations have to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because Britons are less educated in classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However Radio 3 was not the only BBC watch that has been attacked for coming on the heels of commercial competitors during a hearing by the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">A member of parliament from Tori Davidson Collins has attacked The Voice - a music show of talent, which the BBC has bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can see why this program is often discussed because of lack of originality and distinctive features?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall claims the BBC 1 show, in which as judges involved Paloma Feth and Ben George, was done in a "typical BBC style."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home horse," the next time it will launch a entertainment project.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Growth of Internet sales slowed in August, and wine may be Black Friday</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015 there was an increase in online sales by seven per cent</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month marked the slowest growth since it began watching in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales intensified three years ago by mobile devices for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday massacre could have helped deter the grass</seg>
<seg id="6">For about a decade, virtual shopping is booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there have now been signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed just a seven-per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Overall spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they started fixing in 2000, increasing just over five per cent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there have now been signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed just a seven-percentage increase in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the pace of growth in previous years and return to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian's Andy Maltokhi, editor of the IMRG sales index.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained online sales activated three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">That meant more people were given the opportunity to buy online and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now it goes to the plateau and you can see a decline (growth).</seg>
<seg id="14">The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe shoppers could refrain from shopping ahead of the event, which is taking place on the last Friday of November.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past year, buyers in the number of five times the average rushed to the computers to make use of the lucrative offers, by crashing out a number of booksellers' websites.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers go into real fight for lucrative purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound of cash out of every 5 is spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for commodities like TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through internet shops.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online hunter-gatherers than in fashion shops in central streets.</seg>

<seg id="2">Muslims pierce bodies of 29 dead by streets as in Mecca start first funeral</seg>
<seg id="3">Simultaneously Saudi Arabia partially blamed the crash on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group</seg>
<seg id="4">The Department of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed</seg>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere were glassed in the streets to bury the 29 of the victims who died in the crash of the crane at Mecca's main mosque.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed mostly in white, they were present at the funeral procession to the passing of a part to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went to their last way at Al-Moaissem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad procession passed through the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane punched the ceiling of the mosque and fell to the parishioners.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were issued for the funeral, and simultaneously the king of Sawites fined the construction company owned by Bin Laden's family, for an accident in which 394 people were injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bodies of 29 parishioners who died at the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque carried the streets</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead were the father of four children Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram was in the Major Mosque along with his parents before the start of the annual hajj stampede.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Saudi authorities have already pledged that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane to raise at a failed crane.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an Arab version of the decider published by state agency Saudi Press, it says that Binladin Group carries a partial blame for the crash.</seg>
<seg id="15">The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were banned from travelling outside the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week, Salman pledged to find out the reason for the collapse of the crane into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were dug to go to the Hajj this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">Binladin Group made no statement about the crane collapse and its representatives turned out to be unavailable for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper approvals of actions with the meteorological service.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Main Mosque, a massive construction site that leads Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Bin Laden family has been among the closest Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades, and is run by major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a raw material player from whom the family rejected in the 1990" s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accident happened under strong winds and rain just days before the kingdom arrived in millions for participation in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said at the hospital there remain 158 people.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174 000 pounds) to relatives of the dead, and the same amount is irreversible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chapter B & Q argues that the trend is explained by the presence of East European masters working for small money</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Veronik Lori, Britons are increasingly hiring specialists to repair</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing</seg>
<seg id="4">The result is the discovery of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals</seg>
<seg id="5">Simultaneously Kingfisher covers 60 stores of B & Q warehouses all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">By: Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail's chief urban correspondent</seg>
<seg id="7">They say Britons are set aside for a hammer and light brush, and instead employ qualified Eastern Europeans to perform works in the house</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are able to treat the hammer or scrape down the walls, you seem to be in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because, according to the owner of B & Q, Britons are still hired by master craftsmen to perform easy work at home.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronik Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home service network, said that this trend is a substantial influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more than 200 Screwfix stores, specializing in products for masters, and at the same time close 60 stores of B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="12">MS Lori said she would like to see more women in B & Q's staff line-up as eight out of ten decisions on purchases in the shop are accepted by spokespersons of the weak sex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, most of the staff are men.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to her, it is impossible not to notice and the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in the condition of their dwellings than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">MS Laurie said: "In our stores, mostly men are still employed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Steps need to be taken to achieve the balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Overall, half of our clients are women and 80 per cent of decisions on purchased goods are accepted by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a greater role in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">MS Lori is one of five women standing at the helm of the leading British companies, whose shares are registered in the FTSE100 index.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of managers are women, including the general and financial director.</seg>
<seg id="21">MS Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversifying - an important issue for us.</seg>
<seg id="22">Finding suitable women for the board of directors was not easy.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the group took the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for half a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a result of this trend Kingfisher, which owns brands Screwfix and B & Q, opens 200 new stores</seg>

<seg id="1">Time of decision on interest rate of the US Federal Reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">The world is watching the Federal Reserve's meeting, which for two days is discussing the adoption of a crucial decision - to raise or not to hold an interest rate for the first time in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A poll of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that just over half of those who were still last week believed that the Fed on this would go, now believe it will continue to replace and keep a rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered its rate to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time, we are approaching that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Anhele Ubida, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy is working effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="8">He warned markets that they should prepare for change, but everyone talks about their confidence that all the odds are against such a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="3">Now, he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, challenging Tsipras.</seg>
<seg id="4">A few days before the election, he had met with a journalist called euronews.</seg>
<seg id="5">Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to euronews!</seg>
<seg id="6">Vangelis Maymaracis: Thank you for the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Euronews: Nine months ago, your party failed to defeat the Syriza coalition, but now, according to the polls, New Democracy has been compared to it in popularity.</seg>
<seg id="8">What has changed during this time?</seg>
<seg id="9">Wangel Maymaracis: Changed Greece, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Tsipras traveled much in January last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and its growth prospects.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the country has a budget deficit and high unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Investors have gone because Mr. Tsipras has run them.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the past nine months, the Greeks have been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promise of Mr Tsipras.</seg>
<seg id="15">And now they can easily compare the promised with what actually happened.</seg>
<seg id="16">Everyday life became noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens.</seg>
<seg id="17">Euronews: But you say that in the event of winning elections you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.</seg>
<seg id="18">Wangel Maymarakis: The fact is, as we've figured in recent years, Greece can't move forward without understanding and collaborating.</seg>
<seg id="19">And it is no accident that in all other countries where there were or still bailout programs, political forces and all ruling parties were put together to implement a program on which they reached consent without relinquishing their political or ideological autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why I firmly believe that, at the present stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">Euronews: Your party voted in support of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.</seg>
<seg id="22">If Monday you become the new premier, will you carry out this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?</seg>
<seg id="23">Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact we voted for Greece's movement on the European way, because it is well presented that the disastrous consequences would lead the country's exit from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have funds of solidarity, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.</seg>
<seg id="25">All of this would have been lost if there were no agreements with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the current austerity measures were a result of Mr Tsipras negotiating.</seg>
<seg id="27">I know that Europe is unwilling to destroy us.</seg>
<seg id="28">Europe wants to help us.</seg>
<seg id="29">So if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year in power wants to impose order, act rationally, and makes clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am sure, all the accepted commitments that cannot be met because of the recession may be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="30">It would be a mistake to think that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors as they await the full implementation of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="31">If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatise, reform and structural changes that have been agreed by continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and large investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unfortunately, in the course of negotiations, Tsipras's government did not present any serious arguments on many key policy issues that we have learned, discussing these issues with our European counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="33">I can cite an example related to the incomes of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="34">We have explained to our European partners that it is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be taxed in advance.</seg>
<seg id="35">We were told that Tsipras's ministers never spoke about it.</seg>
<seg id="36">That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, but because they failed to negotiate and concluded a bad deal.</seg>
<seg id="37">Euronews: If you win the election, soon you will be at one table with Mr Juncker, Ollandom, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.</seg>
<seg id="38">Will it be different to what you say, from what your predecessor Antonis said to tell them?</seg>
<seg id="39">Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried best to deal with the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners.</seg>
<seg id="40">We were pushing forward the reforms.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and quickness but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="42">The market fell and there was no potential buyer willing to pay the price for the Greek government.</seg>
<seg id="43">I was a speaker of parliament at the time, I was able to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that were up then the governmental majority.</seg>
<seg id="44">And despite their serious ideological differences on the key bill, we had a functioning parliament, and that's in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.</seg>
<seg id="45">And we were able to bring the country back to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early universal elections, which were the result of the December presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="46">Euronews: Recent weeks on Greece's territory are moving the mass flow of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="47">What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries in which these people aspire?</seg>
<seg id="48">Wangel Maymarakis: The Refugee Crisis is a bomb of the slowing action that we have to deal with after winning the election.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the reason was that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.</seg>
<seg id="50">In such matters, it is necessary to act ahead, because if the problem falls you are only extraordinary measures.</seg>
<seg id="51">And we are in such a situation now.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even the interim government, smashing Syriza in just seven days, did more than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which provides valuable assistance to the president of the republic calling for a summit of the EU, will allow to find a solution.</seg>
<seg id="54">We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of any extraordinary events that happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="56">This question has a deeply humanitarian aspect and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.</seg>
<seg id="57">The relevant decision should be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.</seg>
<seg id="58">We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee intake centres.</seg>
<seg id="59">We must also effectively use the economic aid we receive from the EU to be able to deal with this urgent problem.</seg>
<seg id="60">Euronews: Mr Maymaracis, thank you for the interview.</seg>
<seg id="61">Vangelis Maymaracis: Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Mathews wrote a note saying he "regretted" the first murder and would like to "all recover back," the authorised authorities said on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gotye, Mississippi, reports a lecturer in geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 at around 10 a.m.</seg>

<seg id="6">He reported: "Last night I killed my wife," and also mentioned that the house has a "pineapple," which "nobody will touch" but is probably upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police were asked the name of the caller, but he did not name it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe did not explain why he opened the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Having arrived at the scene of the crime, police discovered there body Amy Prentiss, 41, and written off the arm of a note from the lamas, 45, who said: "I'm sorry I would like to return all back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.</seg>
<seg id="11">Writing the note, Ash drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Itana Schmidta, a history teacher, and the evening on Monday when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="12">The university's rector, William Laford, said he was not aware of any conflict between Travis and Schmidt, but "Mr Mr Lambert clearly had something on his mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the information on Monday that they had foreseen the novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of the "love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">About Prentiss has withdrawn as a "good man" by Sean O'Stein, who is reported to have been married to her for about seven years.</seg>
<seg id="15">They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Stin said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19 and that she is "inconsolable."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Lindsey Noulys, who the San Gerald newspaper calls a close girlfriend of Prentiss, the latter was working from home through the internet.</seg>
<seg id="19">Noulz said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lythning clique and that she had met with Travis for about three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Does David Cameron know about "Lorraine" anything else?</seg>
<seg id="2">Each parent is very quick to learn one thing: If your child likes some book, it will take a little while before you know it almost by mouth.</seg>
<seg id="3">Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Responding to a question by a spokeswoman for the organization of children's holidays in a holiday, about their favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with environmental dodgy, written by Dr. Susan in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "This hilarious, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to your kids is because it always reveals some image or message that we skip."</seg>
<seg id="6">And all would be well, apart from the latest paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recount the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the iconic film, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to a variety of fairly short original storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the surrounded by high walls of the city Almighty, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Odri - the girl of his dreams, having performed her desire - to see the real tree," - read us in the text a description of the love story, the unknown Dr. Susan (real name Theodore Susan Heisel), who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it doesn't seem to be too suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost as a brief recount of the movie "Lorax," posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded by high walls of the city Almighty, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Odri - girls of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems unlikely that Cameron, while admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which not named after name the boy learns about how the greedy cutting of trees and a visionary "commonright" of Nakhodka's protests (whose name has been made in the name of the book) is a funny creature with usas, which "speaks on behalf of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to the executioner, who had never read a child with a book 20 times in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokesman said the text was allegedly received from Mr Cameron's office in the constituency.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed the text was obtained from Mr Cameron's headquarters, but further comment was not followed.</seg>

<seg id="1">For Adam Lite clearly there was a risk not to get into the squad of England, but it's still a complicated issue</seg>
<seg id="2">Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an impossible task, but if you look at the assembly that England has chosen for this tour, the replay of the Test series with a score of 3-0 that happened last time doesn't seem to me likely.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would also not rule out winning on my field.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alister Cook's team is perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but in it there are players who have virtuosity, virtuoso taking steep balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, and only the youth positive.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moen Ali turns a bowling ball, clipping the steep balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for Test level, is an attacking option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Still on the subject: Adam Lite has been out of England's Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Haylins</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to rule out Adam Lita to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven Test matches have had two good attacks in challenging conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that the cricket players are scoring judges according to the result.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no questions on Jay Ruta, for example, that led to this announcement because (and I have already said this before) players best choose themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pair half-grinded and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own fortune.</seg>
<seg id="11">We hope that if he takes more wounds for "Yorkshire," there will be another possibility.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his mood, even when he did not show what he is capable of, and that is not surprising; he is primarily a team player and then everything else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time will pass before the benevolence of Test cricket will leave an impression - a complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trent played in seven games as well as Sam Robson to him, and Nick Kompton is nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play on his and on the alien field.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Trotter for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best form but this lost opportunity is already in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hays appears, and he is a bistman, whom I assess highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's an unpredictable cricketer that we were and seeing at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.</seg>
<seg id="19">He should at least be given the same opportunity as someone who has been before him, but it will certainly depend on the team's composition in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The thought of putting Moan next to Cook as the opening batter, which would have given an opportunity to introduce extra spinners, retaining four speed bowling, is vociferous and I'm not at all against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is no reason why a beating player can't beat the ball, but the left-winger has already shown that he is a fucking good cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen, perhaps not quite what's needed for his county Vustershir, but became the third number for them, and the big difference here is No.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team-mate Justin Langer has played his first 38 Test matches for "third bionic" before coming out as the opening scorer in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He won just three hundred and not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a reserve spinner, and when he was there, he showed me a very promising young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little bit, and the pick up the youngster.</seg>
<seg id="27">He is learning a lot about this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahle Jayauhorina, a shrier-lanyard bartender, as a consultant for Test matches, could have been a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the best guys for the game, which brings the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood is included in those games where a white ball is used and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the grid.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes the new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strengths to the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">Kohli's co-star Ben Stouks is left for one-inning, Rutoff is given a similar break due to Australia and I, for example, don't care about the problems.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although not everyone will agree, coaches and individuals selecting players do not specify the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are never made easy.</seg>

<seg id="1">UK supporters' camp out of EU could win if the economy is in depression by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's ill-conceived policies on renewing negotiations to keep Britain in the EU each day are increasingly difficult, even without looking back at the election of genial Jeremiah "This is yes or not?" - Corbyn leader of Labour or the TUC's indignation over Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The foreigners also have their Korbine and Nigel Faradji.</seg>
<seg id="4">A friendly European diplomat explained recently that the situation in which the EU is currently experiencing a variety of crises is not all of their own making - some of the country's member states on the throat of the British ego-centric agenda of concessions and undermining arrangements of change they largely do not want.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC has decided that he doesn't want them anyway if they break up social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it "the village of Dave and George's camp."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Premier and the finance minister are riding summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against a backdrop of a known local monument, in a company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies to reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts to Britain under the EU's EU - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - suggests that the submersible ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding of when they will still be left and left.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, the highly cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her worsen as she has deteriorated to the ambush on her seat of Thatcher (11 years), Mitran (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or a replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He, too, loses power.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland could soon gain a nationalist right-wing government, Spain is the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to see them tumbling out of the skin to help "selfie-razors," whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from going out of the UK - which they also don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even plan to issue a deliberately useless remorse in the SNP style during a referendum campaign in the UK in 2017, to spark the process of Britain's exit from the EU, suggests my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was ideal," and "Britain did nothing much from the resumption of negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans, for their plight, know the predator may be Flit Street, and as sceptical about the EU is set by the media tycoon, in contrast to the time of the running of Tony Biden's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a retired Euro opportunist famed for his "direct bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">With all his stupidity, Ed Millibands knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included a motley company of the feared taxes of julics, cellphone hackers and pseudo-non-residents who own the majority of our large newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair was about them entirely of the same opinion, but gave himself a report that when you are in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her a bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Milliband, Blair was more committed than Blair himself in confronting Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair acted in favor of the EU's repeal constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press did not forgive him.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Milyab Jeremy Corbyn, who friendly booing me on his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to spend it on me - seems to risk repeating the strategy of the Nile Kinnock "boycotting Murdoch" from the 80s - a mistake and then, and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press - not with me, but quite exactly with Andrew Marr, on the tea of a diver in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, most people outside the trailblazing trend of UKIP and the broader circle of "supporters of small England" among the torches could probably say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="29">It is the same as Hilary - "Benn, but no benevolence" -Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his domestic boycott struggling to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbyn skipper John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">That reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled to get on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far and losing his post in the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="31">The battle of Hillary was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the fight to stay "under any circumstances" is Benn's phrase - not that, McDonnell said, and not that J. K. spoke to the bees and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, admittedly.</seg>
<seg id="33">In order to be able to tell the Democrat and "his fellow" Korbin - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of the messages remains an important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, the point of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is reasonable - not to give Cameron so just to separate from Europe, allowing him to take as granted the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins is definitely so thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the main fallacy of McDonnell and Corbyn over EU membership - within the "benkering" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism generated by insignificant distinction is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As for his misgivings about Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that J.C. will not campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to bring this to their leaders at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin be spending political capital - they too have suspicious voters - to surrender to Britain, when it can all be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the government of the torso in power cuts expenses that I was reminded on Monday during a lunchtime at a non-forum called British Influence Security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England</seg>
<seg id="2">Statements by the agency's government-funded agency that e-cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were heard at the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its electronic cigarette report.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive survey of evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers questioned the authenticity of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month split "an extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the BMJ article, two other researchers wondered whether these claims were "solid or firm grounds."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, a lecturer at the European Health Institute at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Klingwell, lecturer in clinical epidemiology at Leeds University, reported: "A fundamental principle of health care should be based on proof of efficiency."</seg>
<seg id="9">According to them, the public expects the PHE claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tabacocration" was based on a detailed breakdown of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, it is derived from the only meeting of the 12 people assembled for the development of a multicrito analysis model of decision making in order to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with the various nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in scientific publication.</seg>
<seg id="11">Makki and Kepwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, a general directive reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also confirmed BAT certificates in the health care report on sustainable development.</seg>
<seg id="13">One in 12 people at the meeting announced a funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding it reportedly had previously received from Philip Morris's tobacco company.</seg>
<seg id="14">A reasonable explanation for the choice of council members was not available, but among them there are some prominent supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom have also claimed to fund the industry in publication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is not known if there were other participants in the management experience in the tobacco case.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco business in PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The scientific paper, published by the group, is "graceful agrees" that there is a lack of "weight evidence of the harmful impact of most products on the majority of the criteria," wrote McK and Keewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links and limitations have been affected in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">Makky and Keewell told PHE that PHE claims that "at present there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, resulting in children or non-smokers to smoke," are premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and welfare in PHE, said that BMJ's statements had previously been given the answers.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "e-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than tobacco."</seg>
<seg id="22">One of the two chickens died of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence implies that the dangers of health from e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study remote consequences.</seg>
<seg id="24">The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what to prove and what these evidence proves, especially where there were doubts about the relative danger in tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">About 80,000 people a year die from smoking disease and smoking is costing the NHS £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is clear that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the damage done by smoking - we do our tasks in front of the nation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Channel 4 presenter believes BBC should stop EastEnders' series</seg>
<seg id="2">The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would do much for such a successful show as the soap opera about "Plaza Albert."</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson noticed that licensing fees should be used only to create programs that are not produced by other British TV and Radio companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has spoken out with criticism of the BBC for being a public broadcaster, which is sure to look at only a small portion of the audience, on the peak time when competitors go to the show with high scores, and on channels like BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation wanted more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson noticed that he had in his time spent six years unsuccessfully trying to establish a collaboration with the BBC while working on Channel 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can't separate from the thought that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast transfers that could show rival companies not receiving subsidies," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of the BBC's further fate.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you save a license fee that I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should be left with only those programs that are not produced and are not collected by other companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Voice shows the broadcast in prime-time, because the creators want to gain as much support as possible for the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that nobody will show it is laughable and apparently absurd.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go on funding passes that could be sponsored without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they own production.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were no other channels, no doubt a lot would be given to her.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't understand how this can be a public thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think it would somehow embrace the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="15">Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led the Channel 4 channel from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments about the most popular shows on the BBC are tagged with comments by Sky's executive director Tony Ball, who in his lecture memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered the BBC to sell the gigs of EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson noticed that more niche transmissions of the BBC public are "continuing to go on BBC4, where often you can't rate an audience, but the function of the company is accomplished, and it can be charged as an argument in hangovers who excite the income from licensing fees of $4 billion: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transmissions that no one looks at."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I urge you to find a more regressive system about who is most likely to receive.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I wonder, they think so because they're not really watching and listening to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elsten, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "informed, enlightening and matchmaking."</seg>
<seg id="22">He noted that now only a minor part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational - he says it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "informative, enlightening and entertaining."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the partnership, Elstein observed that the BBC should make more effort in such spheres as "Promenadnaya concerts" (only part of them, he said, is shown on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available to watch online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled using sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">On the video you can see how the nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have led the worms with a genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using the sound wavelengths of the sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tiny nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses, too high so that the human ear can hear them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Impulses have an impact by activating neurons, genetically modified, to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Still on the subject: Researchers run brain activity by light</seg>
<seg id="7">Scientists have told that the worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetic," whose essence is the use of ultrasound for the excitation of certain brain cells, heart and muscle, and the source of ultrasound is located outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure whereby a person's brain is sent by electrical impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">The nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He found that the bubbles increase the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasonic waves affect the structures called "ion channels of TRP-4," found in the membranes of some of the worms.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ultrasound waves make these ion channels open and excited the cells that are dealt with are reported in the report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the creation of nematode, which can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 channel channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">During ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves amplified microscopic bubbles and injected into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">This technique is similar to those used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and turn off neurons using light pulses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chalasani argues that, compared to this methodology, sonogenetic may have some benefits.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to the light which is delivered to the desired part of the brain on fiber optic, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can flow freely through the tissues of the organism, so it is not necessary for their delivery to go inside the shingle box.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to take time to make human neurons sensitive to an ultrasound signal," Mr Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.</seg>

<seg id="6">Cassette bombs!</seg>
<seg id="7">Electric lightsabers that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!</seg>
<seg id="8">The cheerful voice and the drawn animation leaves no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition - a parody of parody, prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" the weapons of repressive regime by taking part in the "ExCeL" center in the Docklands Exhibition of Defense Technologies and Security Systems.</seg>
<seg id="9">Related: The DSEI arms exhibition: Authoritarian regimes travel to London</seg>
<seg id="10">But the special campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and the Tube trains demanding to look at them once more.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The important announcement coming along the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by a London subway font with a picture of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.</seg>
<seg id="12">In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers nailed to the DLR line: Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.</seg>
<seg id="13">300 posters are drawn by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" at Becksy's Park "Dismalend."</seg>
<seg id="14">A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a "set of cracker advertising locations," a 6-pound set of gainer keys, which, as a foray, "gives access to about a third of the advertising space on the planet's bus stops."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's Transport Workers have suffered from such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the paedophile ads released by the Special Patrol Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gary Grindon, curator of the events of Cruel Designs and a teacher at Essex University, artists become more demanding and eager to convey political art to audiences outside the galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.</seg>

<seg id="20">A video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by a VCCP agency working pro bono, involving a graphic designer and a voice recorder, also working for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lover was impressed by the promotional silence around the arms exhibition - with a skip in the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's organise them a campaign they're trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They thought to create a more realistic and creepy corporate advertising, but "filling it with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more immersive affair."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal vacuum cleaner at the show," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this vacuum cleaner will not be illegally sold directly at our doorstep.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules of living in student hostels</seg>
<seg id="2">It has already been 11 years since I moved into the student hostel as a normal 19-year-old man, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints on others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Basically what I learned is possible to decompose by eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving to the dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.</seg>
<seg id="5">He urges the chatter: Telling people, from where you have, whether you've got an academic holiday and where it has been, whether you're supporting Corbyn and why you're "honest, neither I hate" Marmayt, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast of hahaha extract, I'll be at myself."</seg>
<seg id="6">Freak out.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others to rest too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even talk, even if you had eyelashes, but they would have given fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Let's go people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">The rooms are often transformed into a pool, half-night cinema and public squares, but they are also a place where people dress and adjust the underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still on the topic: Don't even think of going to university while in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts in universities are unfair.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of shakiness from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendly relationship.</seg>
<seg id="14">It could be hell for someone trying to regain power.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in culture allows you to say, "You like me, and I want to continue with you, but I need you to go, and I've been able to restore the energy I have spent to communicate with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when the co-cadaver is tired of talking - and not knocking to him, but to send an SMS.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way, on the note: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my dorm was following such principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw something.</seg>
<seg id="20">Breeders and friends with the help of baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you start a university life at the peak of the show Bake-Off, then knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and put up a plate of chocolate biscuits - no longer such an odd action, is not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we neighbours, I'll have something baked and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering home treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end it is likely that your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, it depends on how good the baker is.</seg>
<seg id="25">Unblindfolded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to cause people to pretend to be asleep when you're going to get them.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing a meal is a typical crime in student hostels.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, assigning someone's chicken - theft, but is it theft - to take a bit of milk for tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Take care of the owner of milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">Most likely he will offer you not to be shy, even if inside is boiling from rage.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone forgets your things, it's annoying, and I don't feel like it - but try to get to this adult than my neighbor, who poured into my milk fluid for washing dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You don't have to produce a noise that's going to discourage people from sleeping or learning.</seg>
<seg id="33">Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the most people of the saying about glass at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to kill the sound of the drum and the bass guitar as it was 3: 00 in the morning, and in the morning of the exam.</seg>
<seg id="35">In response, the neighbor increased the volume.</seg>
<seg id="36">When he stopped at 5 in the morning, she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then rubbed his music and locked the door behind him for a three-hour examination.</seg>
<seg id="37">Didn't romantically wonder if your future spouse had settled in the same hostel as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before a bit of elbow, clumsy, if you had accepted your neighbor for your future spouse, was fascinating to them, a vicious relationship and would have to see it every day, and perhaps watch as it drags on your side of all your shared friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart doesn't show up - but if a hot neighbour is exactly not your future spouse, try to cool down your own dust.</seg>
<seg id="40">At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the draw and the grass is thinner than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good draw is fun but turns to its opposite in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="42">Take a valuable and interesting lesson of safety by hiding anything - but never in a box of toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Back at the other door and drop the keys into a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but not sticking another thing with a tuck of a Blu-ray Disc to the ceiling more than two times.</seg>

<seg id="1">The imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Amendments to the list of eligible goods for temporary tax-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Izvestia was informed by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In June 2015 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the results of the trip to Crimea commissioned a number of agencies - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emergency Services, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of the yachts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million each year go to European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Russian Ministry of Economic Development prepared a draft of the decision of the Eurasian Economic Commission on Amendments to Perechen of Goods, temporarily imported with full conditional discharge from payment of customs duties, taxes," stipulating a full conditional discharge from payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the ministry, it will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in coastal areas of the country," Lashkin said.</seg>
<seg id="10">This issue has been made for consideration by the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in the foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and on the results of the discussion was also approved by the agencies.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release at import is essentially a grace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development would submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of ENPP, explained Lashkin.</seg>

<seg id="20">If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a constantly growing industry in which a large number of people are involved.</seg>

<seg id="22">Our coast is a little interesting, the only one where the yacht can be operated is the Black Sea in the vicinity of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the great difficulty in this area is extremely strict border control rules: In order to get a walk on a yacht, you need to build up a lot of permits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the Public Council at the Federal Service of Punishment (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in columns of separate blocks for transgender and transvestites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vladislav Grib, a member of the Board, spoke about it.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, depending on the total number of people in Russia who are not determined with sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to envisage individual cameras, blocs or even (if such criminals are many) at the prospect of creating a special colony for transsexuals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Vladislav Grib stresses that defining the punishment of citizens to such isolated places is possible only after the convicts will undergo appropriate medical expertise that will prove that the perpetrator is truly a person identifying themselves as a representative of the opposite sex.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vladislav Grib is convinced that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the punishment.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, the offered practice successfully operates abroad: In the detention centre (where the accused are before the court's decision) there are separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today, this is the only way to work with such criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unequivocally they need to isolate, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in conventional chambers is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">The humiliation of the trenches by the co-cameras is guaranteed," says Vladislav Grib.</seg>
<seg id="11">Depending on how big a city is, how many criminals with undefined floors, it is necessary to count on where to distribute them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detention centres are not exactly needed - only cameras, prison blocks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yes, a separate colony is possible if transgender people are much.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grib explained that in the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized body is created in Russia one, then punishment prisoners transsexual will be able from any regions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Citizens are kept in custody at the place of crime, so the receipt of transvestites or transgender persons from other subjects during the investigation and judicial process is unrealistic, and here is the practice for prisoners in a separate colony - yes, Grib believes.</seg>
<seg id="16">It should be reminded, on the eve of the law enforcement bodies were unable to decide in which an investigating insulator - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug possession of 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozukova (known under the name Alina Davis), because of which a man with a virgin appearance was not arrested.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was released home under a subscription for no-leave.</seg>
<seg id="18">This news was widely discussed on social networks and media, as the transgender mechanism in custody and colonies in Rosalia does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexuals), Nikolai Alexievich supported the idea of creating special places for the punishment of transgender people, noting that overseas it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.</seg>
<seg id="20">Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem is there as well as the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals," Alexeev says.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, the more so that their prisons are more than transgender.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alexeev doubts that in Russia there will be a lot of citizens ready to extradite themselves for transcologists for the sake of getting in an excellent colony.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, it is possible to enter a medical examination before placing people in the colony for transgender people, but not always all is unequivocal.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, in the US, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Menning looked like a man and had already in prison declared he wanted to change gender, Alexeev said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A person can feel like anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="27">But while there are no places to be punished for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will be thinking seriously about the safety of such people and getting into the nuances of their orientation or sexual identification.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health at Russian Federation Boris Lhorutanidze noted that the introduction of a new distribution system for transgender offenders in the colony could severely delay the death of convicts.</seg>
<seg id="29">A commission is created - it is a matter of sexism, psychiatrists hold lengthy observations, it is not one test based on which is made a precise conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today's opportunities for psychiatry allow this.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, and before the end of the sex, the potential patients have always had such an examination - they show exactly whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is necessary," says Lune boiled.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is hard for me to imagine how this system will be implemented in relation to the convict, because on average there is a month.</seg>
<seg id="33">The doctor, although in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that, under current economic conditions, it will be appropriate to allocate funds for building new premises, medical expertise, and transgender people in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is difficult to find out, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it is possible to say that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are at least a small amount," said Lune boiled.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now under the petition before the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgender people and so can receive separate conditions of content.</seg>

<seg id="2">Khanty-Mansiysk has finished the championship of chess tournaments among juniors up to 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">The end of the Championship was more than intrigued.</seg>
<seg id="4">The winner was determined only in the last round, and became a Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to overtake the regiment of Yana--Khalves, which seemed to be confidently going to the title.</seg>
<seg id="5">Natalia Bukhsa, a Ukrainian chess player, was celebrating the girls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The World Chess Championship in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament range, seemed to lose almost all of the intrigue, as the Polish representative Yasin Krzysztof dude, who has given a series of four victories (the competition is held under the Swiss system in 13 tours), has confidently grasped the leadership.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given that the dude was a qualifier of the primary, and generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the chance that he would miss out on the reached out was quite insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="8">And even when he was able to slow down and allowed Russians Michael Antipovich to cut just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title fight.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Antipovu to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even that would not help win the dude of his party.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, this commitment of the victory, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He confidently managed with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his party to complete the dude, met with a Biden fighter.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player broke the opposition with the Dutch draw.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, Antipes and dude scored an equal number of points - by 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipova had the best extra scoreboard.</seg>
<seg id="16">And therefore it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, the governor of which Natalia Komarov, who traditionally pays much attention to the development of chess in the region, handed over the main prize.</seg>
<seg id="17">And here in the competitions girls intriguing condos didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - for conquering the title was not to lose in the last tour, which it successfully and done.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, the victory of Russian woman Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buckingham.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian athlete remained second with a runner-up from the championship score of 0.5 points.</seg>

<seg id="1">The comfortable rate for the loan is 10-13%.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to experts, the credit market for small and medium business in January-April of this year woke up to 40%.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is your estimated situation today?</seg>
<seg id="4">After the panic of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015 volumes of credit volumes to SMEs decreased significantly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason is clear: A sharp rise in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lending under 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="7">If previously, the bank could lay down all its possible problems in the future, from late to return, it is impossible to do that: Bets and so on.</seg>
<seg id="8">For business the current level of rates on credit of SMEs is not comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.</seg>
<seg id="10">A 10-13 per cent rate would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive yield on them.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does your estimate be satisfied with the demand of entrepreneurs for loans?</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation changed slightly after the Central Bank was lowered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Credit resources have become more affordable.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to our observations, customers began to ask for loans much less frequently.</seg>
<seg id="15">First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today one way out of business: It is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and region.</seg>
<seg id="17">More closely follow current results, control the movement of cash.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies will be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.</seg>
<seg id="19">All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the main trends of credit market development and will affect its development until the end of 2015?</seg>
<seg id="21">Will the interest rate change?</seg>
<seg id="22">The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the central bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating the consistency of lowering the key rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the radical decline in credit prices for SMEs is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes the necessary interest rate for real income.</seg>
<seg id="25">Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even at the lower rates of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Given the level of delay, small and medium-sized business companies, which are limited to both replenishment of funds and alternatives to correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.</seg>
<seg id="27">I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.</seg>
<seg id="28">The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is so written the word Mazda Japanese hieroglyphs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Beautifully, lacklustre and at the same time it is rather difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.</seg>
<seg id="4">So also the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: Without being prepared attractive outside, technically perfect inside.</seg>
<seg id="5">Japanese, simply by virtue of its "japanese," can bring affection to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to the state of total delight.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is possible to make arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the whole conversation is sent away from the final phrase: "But it is a Japanese car!</seg>
<seg id="7">And argue not about anything!</seg>
<seg id="8">Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also all other Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="9">To quote from the turn of the main, to give food of wasabi, to collect the catana and to dress his girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but on the canons of a street Japanese fashion: Nice, creative and quite unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="10">Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.</seg>
<seg id="11">She has amazing qualities: Both sensual and strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">And the girl older, the skirt is shorter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The main change in appearance of CX-5 is a resoluter of a radiator with five horizontal lines.</seg>
<seg id="14">But it is much more difficult to change the shape of the car with a new drawing of headlights and rear lamps, which the car will see instantly in the flow of the machines.</seg>
<seg id="15">As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.</seg>
<seg id="16">The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance of it is filled with the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Call the police won't have to.</seg>
<seg id="18">Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, one can experience only a stoic Japanese calm.</seg>
<seg id="19">The diesel engine of the volume of 2.2 l provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the power unit is exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.</seg>
<seg id="21">Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...</seg>
<seg id="22">To add to this image a bit of black humour, you can choose leggings with the princess from the police tape Not Cross.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the Mazda made a maximum effort to get the CX-5 at the place of its own accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">To further enhance the comfort, while maintaining excellent manageability, the suspension has been redesigned by the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower levers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The system of complete drive is adapted under Russian conditions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Traffic noise from the road and the engine at high speeds reduced by 13 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">A swimsuit or stripper is as dull as a budget sedan.</seg>
<seg id="28">Otherwise, if the girl smashes in a swimsuit with the original pattern.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing genre.</seg>
<seg id="30">Attention to it then will be less than the new CX-5!</seg>
<seg id="31">The new CX-5 has improved construction of both the front and rear seats, which provides the optimum margin of space and for wide shoulders, and for long legs - who than possesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Another long-haired will appreciate that the upsides in front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't beat on the ankles in the vibe.</seg>
<seg id="33">The widest range of Mazda's active security systems is offered on the CX-5.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kiev broke the atomic ounce.</seg>
<seg id="2">Kiev officially issued a refusal of Ukraine from cooperation with Russia on completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.</seg>
<seg id="3">The High Court of Justice on Wednesday agreed to cancel the agreement with Moscow after the second attempt.</seg>
<seg id="4">The contract for the third and fourth blocks was signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law terminating in 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on construction of the third and fourth block at Khmelnytsky NPP.</seg>
<seg id="6">The draft law was passed only after the second vote, and by the first time it was supported by 210 deputies at the necessary minimum in 226, but then when the project was overshadowed by 234 members of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, which was established under the original project, was to have four coal-fired power stations with reactors of the VVER type, but had only managed to build two.</seg>
<seg id="8">Negotiations with Moscow over the completion of the Intergovernmental Agreement ended 2010 in 2011-2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was supposed that building blocks would have to be paid on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a coup in Kiev in February 2014 and following this cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to collapse relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate in Khmelnytsky NPP and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The only sphere where relations have survived has remained the purchase of fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power plants (have provided about half of the electricity generation in the country) as long as Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" will replace Russian supplies of different types.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plans of completion of Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet refused: As early as 2014 in Kiev announced negotiations with Czech Skoda JS.</seg>

<seg id="2">Yesterday the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod presented the results of the elections to the city Duma by the municipal district, distributing 12 deputies, party lists.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections came from representatives of the CPRF who have accused the voter of "covering falsifications."</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposition comments were not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time the party rejected the parties "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum concerning the abolition of the fees for the trolley of the apartment blocks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city election officially presented the results of elections in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal election district.</seg>
<seg id="7">A total of 1.03 million people were included in Nizhny Novgorod.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than 11,500 ballots were accepted, and 24 were lost.</seg>
<seg id="9">12 mandates for political parties were distributed, depending on the votes they received.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the lists of "United Russia," six seats in the miners rely on Dmitry Svatkovskiy, Dmitriya Krasnovu, Vasilii Shapoanov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Ryabayev and Igor Nagorny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Communist Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the party's only mandate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two Commandments of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanyan and the Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.</seg>
<seg id="13">The three mandates of "Justice Russia" are distinguished by Alexander Razumovskiy, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyukhin.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they should work by deputies in the urban arc: In case of a refusal from the mandate, he goes to the next party candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The chairman of the mining committee, Alexander Makeyev, told members of the commission that it was on duty for the "dispatch of telegrams to Zhirinovsky and other things" on the subject of refusal of mandates.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the adoption of the protocol on the results of the elections, the CPRF representatives declared multiple violations.</seg>
<seg id="17">A member of the miners' party with the right of deliberative voice from the Communist Party, Leonid Krasnokutsky, suggested not to acknowledge the results of voting on the four constituencies # 21-24, pointing out that at the orders of the Head of Administration of the Sorpol district the entrance to the building of the administration, where four district commissions were located, was closed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Within a long time the deputies of Gos, neither the candidates themselves, nor observers, but the resonant scandal with the assault of the gates of the administration were shown in the TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the meetings of the district commissions all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberative voice had an opportunity to attend.</seg>
<seg id="20">They stopped access only when the vote ended and did not yet visit the precinct commissions to hand over their ballots.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was done with the aim of preventing different provocations.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Then the chapter amended, and at all meetings the interested persons could attend," the member of the regional committee Natalya Andrsyshina said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Communists objected that in a blocked building of the administration more than four hours were unlawfully detained by Lyudmila Aristov, who was in charge of what was sent to the investigating committee.</seg>
<seg id="24">The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on the election day began to seal the urn at 6-7: 00 a.m., laying ballots for the ballot in them.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, no one alerted members of the board to the right of deliberative vote and observers, so they came to the beginning of election at 8 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the Urals they could defy the ballots.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the mountains already examined more than 124 complaints about different reasons, according to Alexander Makeeva, there were no violations with the vings of unaccounted ballots did not find.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not supported by the members of the commission and the proposal by their colleague of "Justice Russia" Maria Popova through an obliteration of regional legislation to clearly set the time for the opening of envelopes with the ballot papers, which then fall into the urn.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the course of their own initiative, go to the CEC," suggested Popova Alexander Makeev.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the end of the meeting, a member of the Communist Party, Sergei Samokhin, collapsed at the end of the meeting, shouting that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="31">"You're not here at the rally, excuse me!" the chairman of the election team offended.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="33">The first meeting of the City Council of the Lower New City of the sixth convocation will be scheduled for September 27.</seg>

<seg id="35">According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss the Nizhny Novgorod residents two questions: Whether they agree with the fact that the fees for the capremont of apartment buildings should be "immediately repealed" and tariffs for housing and utilities services "freeze till 2020."</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the lawyer of the city Irina Maslov explained that the circulation of "the Communists of Russia" was contrary to the law.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx's revenue is a mixed character, declining forecasts for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reports on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant of the delivery service has reduced its forecast for annual profit due to falling demand for freight traffic and the growth of costs in its land transportation division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it planned to hire some 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time last year, FedEx reported that hiring 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its shares slipped by about 2.5 per cent at the preliminary bidding for 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts estimated at $10.84 according to the FactSet's review.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decline in the forecast comes despite a rise in rates averaging 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on January 4, and the growth of fees for land transportation of heavy or overall cargo, which begins in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it was still planning an increase in revenue compared to last year thanks to spending cuts, increased gross revenue and the growth of online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company had "worked steadily on account of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">Labour's hiring plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competitor's statement, UPS, of plans to hire an extra 95 000 staff, roughly as much as they took to work last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the quarter, which ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, a 6 percent increase from the year before.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast at an average of $2.44 a share held by Zacks Investment Research overturned 12 analysts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has suffered in recent years from a slowdown in the sector of urgent international travel, resulting in a lack of gross revenue growth in its express transportation division.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the boom of online shopping has dramatically improved the results in the FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, revenue from land transportation grew by 29%, but operating income remained unchanged due to higher costs for large departures and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express transport division has received higher revenue because of higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income has fallen because of increased labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">At preliminary bidding about an hour before the opening of the stock, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and a 17 percent decline following a record of June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At the most anticipated for a few years, Fed chief executives will spend two days this week at a 27-foot-high table from the Honduran red tree, deciding whether to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">At one end, the richly decorated room for meetings with a height of two floors above them will be a wall image of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Jenet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all others.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank received a double mandate from Congress: To maximize employment in the United States and hold stable prices here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal system have recognized that there is a third, unsettling assignment: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third order may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-predictive decision that will be announced Thursday, about whether the US economy is prepared to break away from the risk-free stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most of the data show a steady rise in the economy, recent turmoil in the world's financial markets may hold up and so cautious Federal Reserve officials from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rate, increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait for further," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Federal Reserve will do, which itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an interest rate rise this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to keep it off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30-percent chance of a rapid rise.</seg>
<seg id="13">This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the bid, provided those making the decisions do not soften the blow by the promise that the next increase will be an accident.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The takeaway was provoked by expectations that the incumbents of the Federal system would leave a bid this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It will be a surprise if the Federal system increases rates at this point in time," he observed.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the Federal Reserve's leadership is so, "they will have to go far in the approval of their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts objected that the rate rise could ameliorate financial markets because it would remove uncertainty over how the federal system would operate.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Federal system seems inclined to raise a rate of 0.25% this month, making the first small shuffle in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could prove the strength of the US recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen claimed in the spring and early summer that she expects to raise rates this year despite complaints from the Liberals about the need for greater economic progress.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the emergence of new jobs in August has slowed, labor market growth has been stable this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unemployment has shrunk to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to the level that the Federal system considers to be full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.</seg>
<seg id="24">And, while inflation continues to be below the target at the annual rate of 2%, the Federal System Administration said that the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Scheferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world became shaking at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The average Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% relative to record highs in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could drag world growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has partially reinstated its position this month, and the Dow Jones industrial average is now about 10% below high maths values.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Federal Reserve's management, the outrage of the market complicates the uncomfortable calculations of the rate of interest rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would have turned the screws on that meeting," said Steven D. Oprah, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve student.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is now predicted that they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is greater uncertainty about what implications for the U.S. economy and they have almost no credible data after recent events in China," Oprah said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the world economy is not included in the main concerns of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.</seg>
<seg id="34">But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a global financial authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Central Bank's impact in recent years has been huge.</seg>
<seg id="36">One only hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mute" its monetary expansion, sparked turmoil from markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined with each other, one might expect that Fed policymakers will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making process is "more an art than science," said Zakari Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global crisis management strategies.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve there were cases of overreaction on the financial market movement, which appears to be not related to economic principles."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a member of the right voice of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, insisted on raising rates as the example brought the decision 1998-99.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, "regardless of limited identifiable consequences for growth in the US," Mr Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the heads of the Federal system cancelled these declines.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Federal Reserve should put on the first place a concern for stability only in times of major crises, such as how the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest rate committee at Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The final panic and close did not come close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You would, of course, don't want to be in a situation when you are frightened of the rise in rates because the markets are experiencing a shock," said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute for Peace Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.</seg>

<seg id="1">The president of Syria has called the cause of dislike for the West to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">The West's claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are the fact that they are sovereign states.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such an opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First channel, "Russia 24," NTV, "Russia Today," TASS, "Interfax-'' and "Russian newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="4">Assad said the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.</seg>
<seg id="5">In these countries he would like to remove one person and place the other, which will act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of their Motherland, he noted.</seg>
<seg id="6">Assad has been paying attention to a sharp turn from the Western media since launching a coup in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his words, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West in an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which has come to power by the undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."</seg>
<seg id="8">Putin called on the world community to combine forces with Assad to fight against "Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="9">Commenting on persistent claims by the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the people's consent, through elections, and if it leaves - on the demand of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or the Geneva communiqué.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If the people want him to remain - the president stays, and otherwise he should go away," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them of cooperating.</seg>
<seg id="12">Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader observed that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.</seg>
<seg id="14">He refuted claims that Iranian military units were sent to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tehran supplies us with military equipment.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Certainly, it has a place of exchange by military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange was always carried out," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperation with any of them with a serious desire to fight terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-gambling coalition led by the United States," Assad pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="19">The number of dead has exceeded 230 thousand, and the number of refugees is 11.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="4">A note in the Washington Post is fine because there are no longer passes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, naturally, did not bind and "went out" from the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high mood, without faith, without three rubles of money which are ascribed to him by different characters," he said.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Yes, I was saying that Strelkov was urgently required to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the National Bank of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Boroday stressed that he was not aware of why an American newspaper correspondent had decided to write that the shootings were taken to Russia's "related" territory.</seg>
<seg id="9">I suspect it is a provocation.</seg>
<seg id="10">If that's not a provocation, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word because I emphasised that the shooters had gone away," Boroday remarked.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is slander to me, and on Strelkov," he concluded.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier in the pages of The Washington Post there appeared an article in which Boroday's words were given that he had exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia forcibly.</seg>

<seg id="8">Three days before, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zhukhovsky, stated that local landowners with "probability of 99 percent" found the train with the gold of the Third Reich, which the legends say.</seg>
<seg id="9">Zhukhovsky said that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels will be discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, and the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.</seg>

<seg id="3">Breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all nutrients needed to form a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to high energy needs, pregnant and native women are encouraged to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change of diet that mothers need to do.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a recent study carried out by Robert Watershed, Professor of Medical College London, Texas, it turned out that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing their tumours.</seg>

<seg id="2">World athletics champion Sergei Shubenkov.</seg>
<seg id="3">This season can be called triumphant for a 24-year-old light-athlete from Barnaul Sergey ShUBENKOVA.</seg>
<seg id="4">He succeeded in his coronial distance 110 metres with barriers to win over Europe's team championship, set a few records, and most importantly to be a champion of the world, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprinkler.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "diamond league," having occupied the third place in the common place.</seg>
<seg id="6">New Izvestia asked Shubenkova to share his impressions of the outgoing season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sergey, season for you is not finished yet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Yes, I am going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea, and then I will be thinking about the rest.</seg>
<seg id="9">The truth is that we will prepare for the house, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is still a different state.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is easier than every week to be driven around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">You somehow said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.</seg>
<seg id="12">The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The passion after the main start of the season boiled down, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.</seg>
<seg id="14">One can laugh at the pleasure, at the "comfort."</seg>
<seg id="15">Plus you know that and the holidays are very soon...</seg>
<seg id="16">And the fatigue is there?</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the season is special, there are lots of positive emotions...</seg>
<seg id="18">Fatigue by the end of the season is always piling up.</seg>
<seg id="19">And then it was not important what was doing more - winning or playing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Every contest is stressful.</seg>
<seg id="21">Permanent flights, overriding - all this does not take place for the body.</seg>
<seg id="22">Tired physically and emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="23">But now emotions I have, of course, are on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Yeah what's out there - I'm just happy!</seg>
<seg id="25">By the time you finish the World Championships in Beijing, returning frequently?</seg>
<seg id="26">Sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">And you, journalists, don't let me forget it.</seg>
<seg id="28">But in general I think that bad sportsman who lives old victories spins his successful races over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="29">I was waiting for a couple of days to win - and have to move on.</seg>
<seg id="30">The preparations for this remarkable season were very different from the usual ones?</seg>
<seg id="31">I can't say that there was something special.</seg>
<seg id="32">We started preparing again in December, but the winter competitive season I missed.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was training first at home in Barnaul, then at the assembly, then again at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">All as usual.</seg>
<seg id="35">But with the coach set the task: Try to get to a new level at which I have not yet been.</seg>
<seg id="36">Almost every winter has spent to lay the base.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was a bunch of crosswords, and the exercises on the mediated preparation, which included both traction and the maid, and the back we shook.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then he started the barrier training, there was a lot of technique.</seg>
<seg id="39">For how are the contenders being watched?</seg>
<seg id="40">I always try to do it, good in the era of the Internet with this no problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">He looked at the winter European Championship, and the French were in the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thought another: You have to do something, dilute this company.</seg>
<seg id="43">With each start this season you have added and added in the results.</seg>
<seg id="44">Was that made sure?</seg>
<seg id="45">I have all the latest seasons in the same scheme.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then it's 13.50.</seg>
<seg id="47">Always roll out my form gradually.</seg>
<seg id="48">The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="49">All the work was directed first of all to this result.</seg>
<seg id="50">But there is a paradox in the sense that I feel that I am ready for feats, and in the competitions to show their readiness it is not always.</seg>
<seg id="51">What was it, for example, at the London Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="52">I, if honestly, the semi-final race (Shubenkov couldn't get to the final - "Nose") tried to forget at once.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Yes, even if he had repeated his best result at that moment, there would be a bronze medal winner.</seg>
<seg id="55">But unlucky.</seg>
<seg id="56">Your first World Cup remember?</seg>
<seg id="57">What about it?</seg>
<seg id="58">In Taiga it was.</seg>
<seg id="59">I wanted to get to the final, there was such a maximum program.</seg>
<seg id="60">And took off straight from the loose, in the preliminary scoring.</seg>
<seg id="61">Then he realized that to turn and to fall to the head of the head did not mean to go away at all.</seg>
<seg id="62">In two years at the World Cup in Moscow has already come out in the final with the best time.</seg>
<seg id="63">Well remember my feelings before deciding: Very much wanted to win "gold"!</seg>
<seg id="64">How is it possible to develop decent speed, not lose another head, not to turn off?</seg>
<seg id="65">And that is the most difficult thing.</seg>
<seg id="66">You need to be very careful, focused on technique not to roll down barriers.</seg>
<seg id="67">I noticed that when you configure it not for the result, but the process is so much easier.</seg>
<seg id="68">And the most kitsch when you have a feeling that you are fleeing and all as if it is itself!</seg>
<seg id="69">A fair word, it's worth it.</seg>
<seg id="70">Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.</seg>
<seg id="71">Have you ever had such thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="72">The house is still better.</seg>
<seg id="73">And I can't imagine where I am without my trainer, who do I need?</seg>
<seg id="74">Maybe it would be good to have conditions better, but I try to be happy with what I have.</seg>
<seg id="75">C Klevtsov you've been together for a long time?</seg>
<seg id="76">From the age of 12, since, in the light of athletics has come.</seg>
<seg id="77">More precisely, at first I was training at his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.</seg>
<seg id="78">I started with the sprint, then in the long jump, triple.</seg>
<seg id="79">The children's multi-story was when they put the ball, jump in length from the place...</seg>
<seg id="80">In 14 I tried to run with barriers and I liked it.</seg>
<seg id="81">At the same time, it turned out to be under the norm of the second adult discharge.</seg>
<seg id="82">That's how it stayed.</seg>
<seg id="83">Fear of the barriers has never been the case?</seg>
<seg id="84">Somehow managed to agree with them.</seg>
<seg id="85">But the technology always had to work very much.</seg>
<seg id="86">Beat over one crush of how much tormented!</seg>
<seg id="87">But there is no escaping from this routine.</seg>
<seg id="88">The technique should be cleaned constantly - so that at night I could wake me, I stood up and ran through the barriers.</seg>
<seg id="89">Anyone who saw your fence in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.</seg>
<seg id="90">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="91">I loved it, too.</seg>
<seg id="92">Normally I don't reconsider my race, and I couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="93">But the efficiency needs to continue to operate - no limits to perfection.</seg>
<seg id="94">Don't be afraid now that the victory for the year before the Olympics will be a burden on the shoulders?</seg>
<seg id="95">As they say in such cases, I will try to justify expectations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Once you choose this road, you must go to the end.</seg>
<seg id="97">My coach likes to repeat it: If you're not weak, no extra cargo should be felt.</seg>
<seg id="98">And I absolutely agree with him.</seg>

<seg id="15">The important news for Seventh was an impressive debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series, with the Rafters Erik Thomson.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new drama about the newly ravaged father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children, drew an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Critics argued whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.</seg>
<seg id="18">The result of yesterday's evening is a loud response "yes."</seg>

<seg id="3">Lana Jevon-Fellouz, Sarah McKay and Sneana Markoski may have accidentally made clear who they would win in "bachelor."</seg>
<seg id="4">The woman with whom Sam Wood will remain in "bachelor," is surrounded by mystery.</seg>

<seg id="6">But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Markoski and Lech Jevons-Fellza, on the eve of the day, when three girls would have to stay two, they might have made a hint of the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sam Wood steadfastly keeps silence before the final, which will take place on Thursday</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women come into the lyric mood by telling why Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humour, determination, family values, cheerfulness as a cause for which each of them would be happy to become his companion.</seg>
<seg id="9">But in their answers to the question "If not to you, who should get the last Rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly suggest, who had in fact won the heart of the "bachelor."</seg>
<seg id="10">Jevons-Fellouz and Markoski didn't hesitate to call McKay the perfect pair for Wood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Between Sarah and Sam, a good relationship has been established since the first day.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From the moment I entered the number of participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and understood that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that," Jevons-Fellouz said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Sarah is a very open person, with her is easy and fun," Markoski added.</seg>
<seg id="14">I've seen them together, between them, there really is an attraction.</seg>
<seg id="15">They feel great and comfortable with each other.</seg>

<seg id="17">McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realised that Wood was perhaps the "that person."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realised that this was not just the game - I had all my heart turned to him," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked who should choose Woods, if it were not she, she answered mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle have been heavily interested after his move to the US - as well as a host of other clubs who have sent requests after an impressive open training session late last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and appears to have been a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches would leave Hawthorn on the bench of the spare for the entire remainder of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian league player has admitted for the first return of the pant in a winning game with Minnesota with score 20-3.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to bring back the Pant, and also involved him in the game after Regi Bush's injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula appeared on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of making the newcomers in the presence of the team, he forgets them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne at a press conference after the match.</seg>
<seg id="9">A special reporter for the 49ers" 49ers Club Inman reported that Hain had also received support from the coordinator of the special teams Thomas Macgoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarrod Hain lost the ball to return pitcher team "Minnesota Weibo" during the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="11">At the start of his debut in NHL Hain and his numerous Australian fans clearly didn't count.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was evident as Hain swore, going off the field after losing the ball and later he narrated the lead show "Heather and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which couldn't have imagined a more unfortunate start for a career in NFL.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It happens, you just think about the next game and everything," Hain said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hain matched his team-mates with a debut in the 2007 Origin series when the throw of the ball in his relegation zone brought Queensland's try.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the end, this experience appeared for a 27-year-old player very helpful.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hain photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture to Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="5">Surgery for obesity, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">For several years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but basic research was conducted among people with morphine obesity having the body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at value from 18.5 to 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">IMT 25 or above suggests that a person is overweight and people with IMT above 30 are considered people with obesity.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Min-Sheng General's Taiwan hospital have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - shuning of stomach and elongated gastocomia, with a medical treatment of 2 diabetes patients with little obesity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average value of IMT among those undergoing surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their involvement in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment from diabetes remains at about 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who suffered the surgery fully cured of diabetes by 36%, and partially - 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a group receiving drug treatment, for comparison, the total cure for diabetes was only 1%, and a partial one - only about 2%.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, blood pressure levels, triglycerides and "bad" LPNP cholesterol were "generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the levels of haemoglobin blood cells that reflect levels of sugar in the blood in the dynamics.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7%," the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery the average level of hemoglobin A1c reduced from about 9% to about 6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the best indicators of glycemic control, reflected in good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced the death rate in five years, according to the head of research by Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average outcomes of two types of surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For the fifth year, in comparison with the band polled by a sleeveless touring band, the shuncing group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), achieved a larger reduction of IMT (at 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin versus (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the new study does not show the benefits of the surgical method in part of life expectancy after five years, there are confirmation of the results of a study of patients with an overweight body in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, as reported by Blexstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, the University of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a Swedish study for people with obesity, who pushed the bariatric intervention, the chance to die for 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group in which more traditional methods were applied.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no increase in life expectancy, Blatter noted that it encouraged people with IMT below 35, interested in such a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This report is very important, because it claims to be safe in a low BMI group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blatter added that people and their doctors should start to seriously treat the weight as a patient's BMI falls into the range between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I believe we take too long to get people to treat this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">It seems to me that once they have accumulated genetic changes that run into their bodies of obesity and diabetes, reverse is very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.</seg>
<seg id="2">Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to place themselves as tourists, who in 2018 will come to watch the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rest of the hotel is not in a hurry to receive appropriate permission.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities urgently have to invent, how to settle all the guests of the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosbalta's interlocutors believe that because of the tournament the cost of renting the rented apartments will rise by 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing will have to overpay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of the Russian hotels.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the law, under the leadership, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and level of service.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is now clear that it will not be possible to do so: Hoteliers are so worried that they often do not send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service on Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the head of MFAS Vadim Vladimir, the department has studied 138 hotels and has now plans to have 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust agents.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are signs that the management of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, noted Vladimir.</seg>
<seg id="12">The problem is that there is virtually every room in the account, no one should be lost in front of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials suspect that during football championship fans will take all Petersburg hotels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now in city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand numbers.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two-- and three star hotels, 550 are one-star.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gvichie, at the moment classification took place only 23 hotels - so many audits carried out accredited in St. Petersburg companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">And they ordered a similar procedure for regional enterprises, Smolny by surprise.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is, there may be more or more classifications, but nobody knows about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">"For the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to undergo classification," acknowledged the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Ekaterina Shadskaya.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is explained by the high season, during which the hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to engage in other activities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another reason is the budgets that have not been put into account, and the procedure may cost the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100 thousand rubles and more.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, at the last time the heads of the hotels became activated and began to apply for classification, wrapped Shadskaya.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hotels must have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will also not get the right to work in the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is already known that depending on the star there will be a fixed fee for the hotel number at the time of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="25">The formulas on which the value will be calculated will be announced next year.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is done in order to avoid a rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is necessary to have a conscience and not to let the increase in two or three times, but also the hotels should be given to earn.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.</seg>
<seg id="29">Vadim Vladimir, in his turn, is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">I do not know the extent of the economic theory, but I hope that this measure will be justified.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It's better rampant appreciation," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is unclear what will be with popular cheap hostels.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Duma deputies introduced the bill, according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are very hopeful that this law will not be accepted or will not be related to St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="35">"We will defend the view that the hostels have to be preserved," Nana Groves said.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it said owners of mini-hotels should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the Duma approves the bill, approximately 80% of the hostels will be approved in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to the president of the Association of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the Northwest Leonida Garbar, there are no two - and three star hotels in Petersburg, who are in demand for football fans, but there are retracts in the side of hotels with four and five stars.</seg>
<seg id="39">This situation is analogous to the situation when "there are 75 thousand vibe sitting in the 80-thousandth stadium."</seg>
<seg id="40">This can be corrected at the expense of mini hotels.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their possible ban by the expert considers "idiocy": "It seems odd that some people live in the flats, but the visitors cannot."</seg>
<seg id="42">If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that's wrong.</seg>
<seg id="43">But if as a hotel to which guests come for a short time, then why not?</seg>
<seg id="44">Mini-hotels are at risk of skipping the World Cup and because of their nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="45">Whole hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to go to the classification, with the foundation of their own.</seg>
<seg id="46">By the summer of 2016 the work will be done by all the hotels of the city.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will give away less paid orders from the mini-hotels, and will choose those that are being undermined," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities such as Moscow and Volgograd, the test scores at the moment are much higher than in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="48">The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is related to the permanent battles in the tourist bloc of the government, which does not contribute to the coordinated work.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels do not have enough, which will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and recreation houses.</seg>
<seg id="50">For example, in the name of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg the city can mobilize the river fleet, i.e. the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition, many fans will prepare themselves for the furlongs in which it is possible to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="52">"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so that they are empty," Gennady Lamshin said.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is also very popular during a football championship to enjoy the use of removable housing.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most likely in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rent rates will rise by 10-30%.</seg>
<seg id="56">"From the obvious - the first will leave housing near the stadium," said a specialist in rent of the Agency for Development and Research in real estate Larisa Bragin.</seg>
<seg id="57">And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bed areas.</seg>
<seg id="58">It will contribute and build new transportation solutions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.</seg>
<seg id="59">We should not forget the human qualities of the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not simply tip the road, but can also take a mini-excursion.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are complications as well.</seg>
<seg id="62">My dad in the 1970" s met a family from Murmansk - a father, mother and two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">It was difficult for them to sleep: The hotels were difficult to sleep at the station, and they were hard to sleep at the train station.</seg>
<seg id="64">"And the pope brought them into our communal flat," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, he added that there are now no such features in the city residents - calling for themselves home is fraught with consequences and frightening.</seg>
<seg id="66">But maybe in 2018 after the failed Duma decisions, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to be remembered?</seg>

<seg id="1">Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.</seg>
<seg id="2">With admiration, today I looked at Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma.</seg>
<seg id="3">He did things when our generation was still only learning to trade newspapers, and is still in fine form.</seg>
<seg id="4">The topic of the speech seems to be "the LDPR protest against election results in the Amur region."</seg>
<seg id="5">The protocols are not trickling - for nothing; other protocols other than the signed electors, the LDPR apparently does not.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here he raises the second place Ivan Abramov and shouting something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"</seg>
<seg id="7">And then, at the same time, you get to the Motherland, and then, after the quagmire already with the chairperson, will put the faction out of the boardroom, with the how-to of you, literally, "You are all with the fronts of your jibs and lice."</seg>
<seg id="8">The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov but on the scandal and the demarcation of the faction as a result of this scandal and insults.</seg>
<seg id="9">In reality Wolfenovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region along with Abramov.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the whole country, this is a further rise of Zhirinovsky in the style of "pods!" rather than a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the faction is formally posturing, and the election, if the Party of the Party and Feysbeth Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, is not recognized, but the leader with the theme obviously tears.</seg>
<seg id="12">He gives the dead to Amura himself to bury his dead, and he is preaching against "United Russia" as a whole and in nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="13">A graceful solution to both the face is not to lose, and in real, rather than a show scandal not to go.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other thing, now in a strange situation, is Abramov himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">Apart from the howling of his superiors, he did not wait to see the protocols, and there are no other protocols.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle - he has become a formal cause and for the abuse of a respected champion, and that is even more abrupt, the Hammam drops in the address of ER and ONF.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then he, of course, should seriously consider what to do.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because of the main beneficiary of the election, the politics number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 on the only regional single-mandate county it can turn into a pariah that has successfully enjoyed its own party leadership and super-irritant for that of the ONF and party leadership alien.</seg>
<seg id="19">That was not to be Zhirinovsky, he should have come to think and respect him.</seg>
<seg id="20">Trump is yet to grow and grow.</seg>
<seg id="21">It has emerged that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is, the bath has fallen at all.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is the only subject of Abramov under a cellar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Tibetan Buddhists has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Centre for Mercy's compassion at Oxford, a devoted to the research of ethics, at the start of its 10-day visit to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="5">He stated that in the existing circumstances the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that, while that is the cause of admiration, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria over the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Taking care of thousands of refugees is fine, but simultaneously you need to think and about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of homicides in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We need to weaken the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of force never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's harsh response had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know that his intentions were good, but he used force and that caused the unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Four-times rise in the number of children who have swallowed a disinfectant for their hands, for the last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Toxicology centers in the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase since 2010, the number of children younger than 12 years old, swallowed by a disinfectant for the high alcohol content, as reported by the University of Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr Guy Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology center, cases of screening of children up to 12 years of fluids for disinfection of hands reported by toxicology centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 1,6117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Kids contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the ambulance unit," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He explained that some children drank disinfecting fluid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or on a dispute for social networks.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the Youtube videos, you can see the teen drinking disinfectant as a cheap drink.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teen was reportedly mixing a disinfectant with a spiral of liquid to strip the mouth to get a more potent drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the most endearing (disinfectant liquids) are those that are flavoured.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectant fluids for the smell of strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">A resolution of 50% of alcohol per hand contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Small children, particularly a handful of sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is a spiral of high concentration," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology centre at the University Hospital of Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="15">You wouldn't leave just so tea with whisky, but people keep up with these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids are up to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Naidge Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently at school swallowed a disinfectant for a hand with a strawberry flavour in a number of roughly four sprays, was sent out for treatment to the ambulance unit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alcohol levels in her blood were 179, twice as many as an adult, who by law is considered to be in a state of alcohol intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie - a doctor of an ambulance who treated her in a Gwinnett health centre near Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naidge putted his words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance station.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to miss any signs of brain injury because of the alcohol girl fell and hit her head, Ritchie said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," told CNN's Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could well prove fatal to my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-piercing substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to the readings to remove disinfectant fluids for the hands of children's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to the deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women from Ontario died after being swallowed by a disinfectant that contained the toxic undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials suspect the product contained methanol - a lethal agent rather than ethyl alcohol - which was listed as an existing substance.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three apprenticeships in the north of New York conspired to poison their "anti-inflammatory" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances into the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">A teacher has a strong allergy to a disinfectant for her hands, and she has banned keeping them in their classroom.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police believe the failed plan was "empty conversations," and addresses questions of discipline to the school district.</seg>

<seg id="1">As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the back of the benches at the entrance to the stolen children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad owl owl.</seg>
<seg id="3">Babies who come for books are trying to feed her chocolates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Several generations have gone to this library for 95 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The earliest readers in the twenty years of the last century organized loud reading, staged performances under the verses of Mayakovsky, conducted literary quiz and corresponded with the wife of Lenin.</seg>
<seg id="6">The correspondence lasted four years and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, every day a "friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The hope of Konstantinovna was even sent once by a distant barnacular to friends his children's photo.</seg>
<seg id="8">And when the barnacles asked if Hope had not objected to the library by her name, she wrote that no, there was no objection.</seg>
<seg id="9">The letters have to be explained for a long time in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain, whose strict profile is decorated with a bas-relief on the building of the library.</seg>
<seg id="10">During perestroika times often called different people, outraged: Why does a child's library not be renamed?</seg>
<seg id="11">Let it be a library of some good children's writer, without political coloring!</seg>
<seg id="12">The staff of the library sat, they thought, and decided to leave it all as is.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Krupskaya" is probably the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul as "leninka" in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the floor in the library lobby - a track from the yellow brick.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The magician of emerald city" is the favorite topic of the artist Oli Moskovka.</seg>
<seg id="16">Before Ol was a manager at law company, coming to work at eight, had gone to five, and from all the other managers differed only by love to drawing.</seg>
<seg id="17">And then found an ad on the Internet: "We need an illustrator for the book."</seg>
<seg id="18">The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy."</seg>
<seg id="19">Oulla made illustrations, and thought: Life can end at any moment and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and creates fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...</seg>
<seg id="22">But some reading children go to see the children, and their parents understand the meaning of reading.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent years, we have had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids who go here!</seg>
<seg id="24">I think the interest in reading comes back.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition window with updated photo exposure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once in a quarter there are new pictures of readers who go to the library with all family: Mom, dad and children.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the library we are glad that with the children it was increasingly coming to the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="28">If in two years the child had read the whole Chukovsky, at the age of older he needed books to be more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="29">But now there is a law on which an eight-year-old surfer is prohibited from giving books out of the category 12+.</seg>
<seg id="30">To receive such a book, the child must bring with them parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the library there is treasures - prerevolutionary collection of bulls with the atons and ers, by the novel of the King in the annex to "Niva" magazine, "Murzemakers" for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: Not home, not work, not school," explains Tatiana Kachiva.</seg>
<seg id="33">To us it is possible to come to all to read, play, break.</seg>
<seg id="34">We have made the game for the kids - the child comes just to play, and the wheel is still drawn to the book!</seg>
<seg id="35">Some of our readers are sick, and they fall with knives, they don't want to leave.</seg>
<seg id="36">Often come mom with a stroller - and we are pleased that the library they put on top place among all the other places to come with babies.</seg>
<seg id="37">Tatiana Kushina says: Modern children are the same as we once love classical children's literature:</seg>
<seg id="38">"The publishing business is developing, and much attention is paid to the authors who are the link between the generations."</seg>
<seg id="39">And if you talk about small kids, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.</seg>
<seg id="40">Kids don't like partying with their heroes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The library is constantly releasing booklets for parents, which describes what is going on in modern children's literature, which books worth paying attention to and why.</seg>
<seg id="42">The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that the adults are interested in, but this library is not for them.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is forbidden to make books outside the reading hall.</seg>
<seg id="44">This magical privilege is only available to children.</seg>
<seg id="45">... In the most distant room of the library there is a square one with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the book guard.</seg>
<seg id="46">The steps will be sharpened under your steps - it is already a very old machine of time.</seg>
<seg id="47">From the book of my childhood you are met, as with an old friend: Hi, good that we are not changing with you.</seg>
<seg id="48">Ellie all so much fun walking along the road paved with the yellow brick, the ribbon of the Toll of the bewitches the magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the cursed tempts of the Military Mystery - such that he has a firm word for him.</seg>
<seg id="49">Books like passwords can be found in any place.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are in the repository and real books of redness - for example, pre-revolutionary collection of bulls with the atons and ers.</seg>
<seg id="51">Or to lead the King in the famous annex to Niva magazine.</seg>
<seg id="52">Or the "Murzemakers" podcast for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="53">The time runs out of the page, split them into a teaspoon.</seg>
<seg id="54">These publications are not presented to these readers.</seg>
<seg id="55">This fragments of our future collection, I all dream of - will retire and go with rare children's books.</seg>
<seg id="56">But the kids on it already, so to speak, will not tell: And the paints in old books are not very bright, and themes... open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now it seems: Why did we all write this "pioneer truth?"</seg>
<seg id="58">But everything was interesting," said Galina Iowsova, "The Russian Planet," the head of the book shop.</seg>
<seg id="59">Murzkoff pages have darkened from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="60">Galina Vasilyevna has headed the bookkeeper for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="61">She knows the colors of the Buratino skipper, in which academic year Harry Potter was the captain of the Griffindor team at the Kviddich team, in which Carlson uses a glitter for a motorist, and by whom the father of Alice Selezne works.</seg>
<seg id="62">The librarian's work pays little, and anyone who can live without these book ranks is very quick to find another profession.</seg>
<seg id="63">Only the most persuasive: Enlighteners, pedagogues, service members of the book's cult.</seg>
<seg id="64">They can also be learned by smiling - it is considered that it is a professional feature of children's librarian.</seg>
<seg id="65">If he smiled at you in the first minute of conversation was a professional.</seg>
<seg id="66">I really like children's books: As a librarian, I like them to be so beautiful and beautiful on the shelves, and I love them to read them," says Galina.</seg>
<seg id="67">I read everything: Military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.</seg>
<seg id="68">Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...</seg>
<seg id="69">Of course, I think, in my childhood, everything was different.</seg>
<seg id="70">The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me.</seg>
<seg id="71">And as I madly loved them, it seemed to me that the library was a magic place.</seg>
<seg id="72">And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.</seg>
<seg id="73">I hope that the books will always be, despite the freaks.</seg>
<seg id="74">And I rejoice when our former readers bring the children, and the grandchildren...</seg>

<seg id="4">The "Dons" increased the advantage before "Seltik" to five points</seg>
<seg id="5">Penny Adam Runi in the first half gave the "Aberdeen" a slight advantage over the "Hamilton" at Pittodrie, which allowed the Dons to break away from Seltika by five points.</seg>
<seg id="6">Griffiths refuted talk of controversy</seg>
<seg id="7">That sparked rumours of the controversy in the Selfika, which was tackled by Griffiths, who claimed he and his teammates don't suffer any heightened criticism, preparing for a meeting with the Dutch League leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't think we're feeling the tension, I believe the players are keen on it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dutchman is bored because Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Bur</seg>
<seg id="10">The former midfielder from Rangers and former member of the Netherlands defender Liz de Bur has claimed Dutch football fans have lost interest in Seltics since he is unfazed by the Rangers' title against the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Bur, now an A-League spokesman, said: "In the Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of the Selfica games, and why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">That's because there are no Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="13">People here speak not only about the return of Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="14">They talk about "Old Firm."</seg>
<seg id="15">They talk about both teams together and that's what their interest is.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the games of the Old Firm lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I'll change everything," said Deila</seg>
<seg id="18">Ronny Deila admitted that "Seltik" is in difficulty, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a defeat by Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by a losing 10 of Aberdeen football players, who are now relegated to five points, ranked the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila declared: "Selitka" had bad periods before and we would go out again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to get out of it as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="22">I understand that it is very unfortunate, and many people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="23">And we too, but we need to continue.</seg>
<seg id="24">And we really, really need the support of Seltika because from that players get much better.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is so important to stay together now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Warberton with mistrust awaits January transfer</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite the opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he has identified some of the goals of the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warberton with distrust relates to the January campaign, claiming he does not want to disrupt the team's unity.</seg>
<seg id="28">The former Brentford attacker declared: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptations that you have and seen in our own group this season.</seg>
<seg id="30">The team is doing really well.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes, more damage is done by adding unwanted players to the ones you really need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mitch, who is interested in "Seltik," hinted at the completion of his career.</seg>
<seg id="33">Suonsey's forward Mitch, linked with the Seltik during the transfer window, hinted he could leave the football after completing his contract with the Swan.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years and has not been able to leave Wales this summer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Harts gather to confront SFA over Nate Myles' claims</seg>
<seg id="36">"Harts" led with a score of 2: 1 when removed Paterson, and began to lose 3: 2, but the red card defender was later cancelled; it was Collum's third red card, annulled for eight months.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson disclaims his words, claiming: "I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths has vowed to avoid Taipei</seg>
<seg id="39">The stubborn player of the Hayberbatch player has received a reprieve after admitting that sang the song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudi Scacela.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident happened at a pub in the Rhode Island area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby on Tyneside in March 2014</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was a derby and it was hot," said the attacker, adding: "I can confidently say that I was not going to return to Tyler if he did not play for the Seltik.</seg>
<seg id="42">Donnelly: Council Tannadis confident of "Dandi United" management</seg>
<seg id="43">Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of "Dandi United" is still confident that a team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.</seg>
<seg id="45">We'll prepare the guys to go out again," Donnelly said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Macinnes glad 'unbeautiful' won at Henmilton</seg>
<seg id="47">Derek McInhope admitted his team Aberdeen had to desperately fight against "Henthorn Assis" to achieve a seventh consecutive victory in the league's primary league, which put them in five points above the "Seltika," the top of the tournament table, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rundle in the first timeout.</seg>
<seg id="48">Mak-Inure said: "There is no such team here, which would have something to win - the Cup, or the league championship, who did not win a meeting in the same way."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I am a witness to the executions in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Today, dodging legal interventions at the late stage, I'll be looking at how to execute a man.</seg>
<seg id="3">If that happens, and I hope I still don't, I'll be sitting on an observation gallery on death row in Oklahoma City, when Richard Glossip will be executed with a lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time this request was made as early as January, through his close friend, and although I was tapped into shock, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">With the approaching of this day I became afraid.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed as I thought it was a good way to tell detailed story of the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">That would suggest a unique race.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and, as those who wish often more than seats, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Oklahoma, the number of media outlets reduced from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is selected, he will look at it without emotion.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'll sit with Richard Glosser's closest friends and have a relationship after several months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like this guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh when we talk to him.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison administration argues that I can't be simultaneously a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">One Oklahoma journalist accused me of being biased in my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I had complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She recognized that she herself "could have been better prepared to formulate," but still believes that I am not right in what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip did not agree a lot with what I said and wrote.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he had spoken.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he could dismiss me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants a journalist of international publication to be present to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he believes that glasnost will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Belinda, a reporter from the "Haffington Post," will be with me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about this, listen to podcasts that I have recorded.</seg>
<seg id="31">I won't go into the details again.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of an accomplice to the crime.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I firmly believe that the evidence for a fatal sentence was not enough.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe his execution is flawed.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from that radar I'll watch him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be fully objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters for whom to apply.</seg>
<seg id="40">From me you learn what it is - to look like the person I like, dies without necessity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody accuses stun guns of trying to spy and threatens to withdraw from horse racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria in an attempt to introduce a spy at his concoction last year and threatened to immediately leave the horse racing.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was targeted by stewards and operations manager Racing Victoria, whom he accused of orchestrating a campaign personally against him, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatai because of violating the rules of application of medicines on the start day, on Wednesday, was the latest straw.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he always applied all the efforts by participating in the races, and he was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive result of Lidari's test of cobalt, which he could not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He held the tongue on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "look like green grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to talk about it for a long time, but sometimes you get that out of your knees, which is no longer deterred," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes react and then you have to survive the consequences and I'll have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today I will go home and be able to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk high with my head and want my owners to know - I do my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they start thinking that's not the case, then I'll need to stop being a coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then I will have to think what to do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Muji sensationally declared during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stables.</seg>
<seg id="14">"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dave Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with the man I called, if asked, and offered him a job at my horse in order to transmit information about what I was doing at my horse," Moody said at Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They clearly believe that I'm a fraud.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is true, they should surely be given the claim, as trying to catch them has failed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Rolleston, former chair of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, the RVL executive director, knew all the time and know now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shouldn't it make me think the case is becoming personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Should the RVL be emboldened and called to account for what is happening in this business, other than the coaches?</seg>
<seg id="20">Is I bad for this profession?</seg>
<seg id="21">Is I bad for this profession?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people out there think that's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away and I have no doubt - what I am now saying can make them think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I have reached to the point where I still do, and it is my sorrow.</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm really sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put pressure on them and charge them for making a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support from the family and I can leave.</seg>
<seg id="28">The coach of the coach only grew up in the course of a long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the final removal of the horse from the start forced him to claim that he could "shave his licence off the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mudi, most famous for having prepared the undefeated champion Blake Craven, called the demands for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "laughable" after the horse's leg was dealt with a commuters of clay, which is a violation of the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a violation of rules for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have to take full responsibility for that," he declared.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my employees mistakenly made her kompress on the foot.</seg>
<seg id="33">She could get a composting last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">She could get him yesterday as it was.</seg>
<seg id="35">She was with him on the day of the score.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for use of the compressor, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">The people who create these rules know nothing about horses.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need the rules but it has gone too far," Mudi said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy parades accusations of rivals in applying tough security</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of an interception of the ball by his team as "imposing the agenda" by two of the NRL championship favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storma to "fight" with his team during the Storma's sudden victory in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has made a clear hint at "Storm" after his team won the final qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Steelers" night on Saturday when he called the game "typical" for league rugby and claimed two Queensland players were not "too successful" in the manuscript.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy secured an interception of the ball by his team and claimed they were simply focused on "touch," intercepting the ball.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that he has instilled the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, as it means their worries about possible defeat by "Storm."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It continues to pop up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about the tough receptions when they beat us with a score of 24: 2," Bellamy announced on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can make sure that we have not changed all year in our systems or security technicians, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and it has become a turning point for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent there has already been three years and he's clearly training an excellent team, so he's probably not used to losing, and for him it's got some shock.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how that always shows up at this time of the year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy joked about Bennett's idea of "impressive football," having reminded his teacher that "St George Illawarra Dreizons" Bennetta won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wain talks about exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010, St George "had a lot of criticism, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he didn't care.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can show what he considers as impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's football in which you want to play when you have such players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such a midfielder like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can so play.</seg>
<seg id="18">It gives me more confidence, because they are saying these things because they are a bit disturbed by the game with us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they reached the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also noted "Storma" and "Rusters" were a contest with more points than the Broncos and Kauboz.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">In our game he was 20: 18, there were two more tries - and what, is it and does impressive football?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me it's a rut.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they mention it, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storma at the end of this week's holiday, as they won the right to host either "NRL Queensland Steelers," or "Kronalla Sharks" next Saturday night for the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who faces life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland will be released on bail at $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after a federal police discovered 100 kilograms of the drug on a Solay yacht coming from South America via Vanuatu and bound for Kumir in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices saw on the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found a 40kg drug in a Toyota Echo car.</seg>
<seg id="5">In spite of the fact that Maximović faces a life sentence for attempting to impose narcotic substances in the amount sufficient for sale, Mr Maximovich's lawyer claims that evidence that the latter tried to win the entire party is absent and that the man could be in the cafe without any intent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court judge Peter Flecaghan doubted that Maximovich was worth bail.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latter has ties to Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about the location of his residence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mother and stepfather Maximovich were asked to contribute a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"From the testimony of both it is apparent that the amount of collateral of $200,000 is for them too much a financial burden," Judge Flecnagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one measure is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maximovich was allowed free bail on condition that he would deliver both his Australian and Serbian passport, would be celebrated by police daily and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.</seg>

<seg id="2">A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sturt Hogg took the girl's phone while she slept, registered on the internet messaging service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in the arm of sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She checked him and found the shocking photos, and then immediately addressed her mother's attention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police arrived and saw five images, followed by computers found at this address, and discovered "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then told police he had done so because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="8">An authorised judicial officer, Einkey Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dandi: "He claimed it was an addiction, he was addicted to frightening people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted to making requests for the computer but claimed it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to frighten the pedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was interviewed over a conversation with an unidentified man who sent him an image and tweeted he was asked to send still photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he was doing it to lure them away.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he had a problem with his head when he was drunk and claimed he wanted to see images of rape and homicide.</seg>

<seg id="14">She saw indecent images on the phone and then with the accused had been held.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and a "Pioneer" to talk to the girls who looked much younger.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, from Waze Road in Dandi, pleaded guilty to the charges in the manufacture of indecent photos of the children on 14 June last year, violating bail conditions on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court at a hearing on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">The defendant's lawyer Gregor Sim applied for his petition not to add Hogg to the list of persons who had committed sexual offences, because it was possible to prove that there was no "significant sexual element" in this crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alister Karmichael deferred sentencing until October, before receiving medical advice from social services.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was released on bail on the case, however he was taken into custody pending a hearing on other remaining cases.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsene Wenger's captain Mikel Arteta says his one-club players should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb</seg>
<seg id="2">In conversation with Wilshaw, Hungary also stressed that it was only September, and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery was going to be done, he would not be prevented from returning to the game for Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the very best of events, Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more England games and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hurt just in this recent challenge that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hungary: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."</seg>
<seg id="6">It's just not until the end of the healing bone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nothing serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's just circumstantial.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is not related to the ankle or injuries he has had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as the Hungarian admitted, there is a similar risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also an adverse trend.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Premier Records Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries sustained in the six years since his debut.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 games in the league over the past five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you look at the split for Arsenal wide, you may notice that in six of eight seasons starting from 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs, on account of the most missed due to injury days.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Hungarian admits the likelihood of being stuck in a vicious circle but in "arsenal" believe the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, back in order after injury, you are vulnerable - during this time you need to rebuild forces and gain a competitive advantage," said Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough and will cope.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope he will recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as that his career will be the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal start a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday mating with "Dynamic Zagreb" and will continue her Saturday games with Chelsea and next Wednesday - with Tottenham Hotspur and Hungary intend to roll out the squad.</seg>
<seg id="20">Eleanor Bellevue and Aaron Roemzi did not come to Croatia, therefore most likely in the starting line-up will be played by Mathieu Debyukov and Arteta.</seg>
<seg id="21">Perhaps Hungary will also introduce the composition of Kirana Gibbs and Olivier Zira instead Start Moreale and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players that need it," said the Hungarian.</seg>
<seg id="23">Though Arsenal are the undisputed favourites in Group F, the Stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is among the most deferential in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo has not lost to any of the 41 matches since they managed to have past season as "unstoppable."</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake by force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was 10th in Zagreb this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Hungarian is confident Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season when the team defeated the Champions League game from Monaco and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to victory in the Champions League final.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's an incredible drive," Hungary observed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Arsenal never did.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close to the goal in 2006 but, on the other hand, I'm a realist with an internship.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of such stories is thrown into the eye, especially considering how desperate the men's demand for frankness is, now more than ever, with the rate of suicide among young men being at their maximum in 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the only biggest cause of death by men aged between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and with men going three times more often than with women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an attempt to tackle the issue of Campaign Against Non-Private Life declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that does not give men to seek help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take this call.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study by more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression has revealed that if a patient has a fairly large number of friends "in a normal mood," the odds of a cure are doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halve the chance for mental disorders.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course that friendship worked, first and foremost, that she was.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an era where communication is managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the speed of the answer is often appreciated more than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.</seg>
<seg id="11">Such a superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal aspiration for personal growth and friendship, that stronger influences our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games recently observed, didn't buy any more happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The dignity of the Friends is that they are attracted to that attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the characters was determined not through his work, but rather through the personality that showed up in conversation with friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joui and the constant embrace of Chariot, moments of watching football on the comfortable chairs, Rossa's breathlessness on Rachel - all comes from an understanding that men can feel it, even if they often abstain from a full study of their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Samaritans employee said:..." my role of listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal mood highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the men who appeal to us feel unable to speak to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old learning is "live with it," as well as feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-running coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It emphasized the little-noticed moments of the men's friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As for my task, the status of an outside person talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday completely restored scenery, why not take your friends drink at Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better - if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."</seg>
<seg id="24">You don't guess what kind of a friendship might bring in advance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Anhelel di Maria along with Blaise Mathydi and Edinburgh Cavani celebrate scored goals in the gates of Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal than allowed the PSG easily to bypass Malmö on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the report of the match and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chantelle di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani did their thing when "Pari Saint-Germain" started their game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable win of 2: 0 against Malmö at Park De Prens Stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player to question the direction of France's champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when the Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">Alongside Real Madrid and Doncaster Shahter in Group A, "Pari" needed to take a good start in the game against champions Sweden, as they aimed not to qualify for the playoffs, but for the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons where they have reached out to the quarter-finals.</seg>
<seg id="8">They earned points but at the same time was not the best tackle by Lauran Blake to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic's useless in the attack and would later replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy - to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win with the score of 2: 0, to deliver the rivals of problems and to play well in defending - it's a good start, even if there are still some points that we will need to finalize during the season," Blake said.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's promising.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we made it, although I'm sorry we didn't score for one or two balls more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions as part of the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in a match against Bordeaux in the first league this weekend but was pushed back to Di Maria's backfield goal in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine attacker pointed out as a player able to bring a "PSJ" to a new level in Europe after his last month bought either Manchester United, and he proved why when he ran out for a pass from Marco Verratti behind defending Malmö and nicely completed the attack, sending the ball past Johnathan Thurston to the far corner of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if one was expecting an easy and big victory, they had to disappoint them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, who defeated the Selfies in the playoffs to reach this stage by having a combined nine-wicket world level on the pitch early in the game, five defenders and two touchdown midfielders in midfield, were a serious opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, except for the hit, Nikola Djurjic, in which the ball flew past the front side of Kevin Trappe's gate on the 34-point minute, they were attacking quite a bit.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the PSJ have at times pinned themselves with less than five attempts and a weak attack, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half failed to implement at least five tries and then failed to handle the ball scored by the Cavani immediately after the game's resume.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he showed himself a lot more skilfully in a precise graze and it was a passing from Ibrahimovic, getting which, Di Maria sent a ball of season-ending kick that passed the innings to the bar past Wilanda in the 52 minute.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal was finally scored after an hour mark thanks to the Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after an Ibrahimovic sub-footed ball sent to the centre of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only intercepting the ball of Wilde from close range didn't allow David to increase the final score before the substitute Esekel Lavessie didn't score a goal in the concussion of the match.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmö coach Rod Hared later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian telling: "Our last game in the Champions League was held last December."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Qualifying is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Glory "Pari"!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a wonderful match with them.</seg>

<seg id="11">Representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be attending the forum.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be served, including from the Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="13">I hope that the forum will help to broker new profitable contracts and agreements.</seg>
<seg id="14">I added that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than two hundred delegates participated in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">A very important agreement on cooperation between Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.</seg>
<seg id="17">About the importance of our developments is the fact that in Tyumen there was a session of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the Delegation of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in the training of agriculture, identification of additional points of contact and organization of new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have recently met with the region's head and head of the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="20">What topics were discussed?</seg>
<seg id="21">During the meeting with the governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakuzev talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.</seg>
<seg id="22">The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms - they are needed - is needed to reduce the cost of cars for the end user.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problems were discussed in the work of Belshina supermarket trading house and options for preventing losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">Matters are important, because investment projects should clearly work and bring profit to the region.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was said about further deliveries of the "MAZ" passenger trucks, the development of "MAZ" service center, which was created in Tyumen on the base of OJSC "TPATP."</seg>
<seg id="26">The conversation also touched upon the preparation of travel of the region's working delegation to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the current year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Another topic of discussion was the completion of the agreement and signing of the agreement on the trade and economic, scientific and technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.</seg>

<seg id="29">These issues were related to the regional center.</seg>
<seg id="30">During the meeting with the head of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moor we talked about updating of the Tyumen Bus Park.</seg>
<seg id="31">About 100 buses are already "breathing on the lads," because a new batch of cars from Belarus will be needed, which will work in gas, ecologically clean fuel.</seg>
<seg id="32">One more aspect: Tyumen lift plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products JSC "Mogilevskymash," receiving accessories.</seg>
<seg id="33">In my opinion, this activity could be more active, considering the programs to install new elevators at the regional center.</seg>
<seg id="34">I would like to add that in the framework of extended powers of the consul there was a meeting with the governor of Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin, during which the question of increase of turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zauralye was discussed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A meeting with the town governor was scheduled for the end of September.</seg>
<seg id="36">The consular district consists of five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a district headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="37">The region is a polygon for the shelling of many perspective projects, including work of the honorable general consul.</seg>
<seg id="38">In general, such meetings are significant and good to be addressed directly and quickly to solve many problems by removing their sharp and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="39">Under current conditions it is extremely important not to destroy the ass, continuing to work for perspective.</seg>

<seg id="2">Matt Damon ventured with producer African-American Effect Brown, saying behind the scenes that consider the ethnic composition not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the Sunday issue of the Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, the acclaimed actor interrupted Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views of the mainstream black heroine in the chosen scenario.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Diversity is appropriate when you spend casting for the movie itself, not for the show," insisted Dave.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ocharashal Brown, not believing his ears, resented "Ogo, nothing to her own," all the time while the actor from Marsyanin gave the comments in a live video.</seg>
<seg id="6">To discuss the finals of the show for Damon and Brown are joined by singer Ben Afflek and the Farelli brothers.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think of what image interpretation and they are going to stick to," Brown said at the start of the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white sutener.</seg>
<seg id="9">The film's producer, Dear White People, campaigned for film directors Leo Angelo and Kristen Branlcio; Dave was sharply opposed, saying that "as a result we can get none of what we want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After this discussion was shown live on television, social networks blew up disapproval comments to Dave's address.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Twitter user Mrs. Pooni was angry about the show in the video: "It is an explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room Nay, white, that is painful."</seg>
<seg id="12">It has sold more than 5,000 retesses and 4000 "liners."</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's remarks appear just when competent coverage in the media is the most acute issue on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 2014, a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police, Black Lives Matter movement has overturned popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating practices against colored populations.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, the Grammy Awards mentioned the movement during presentation of the "Album of the Year" award at the Grammy Awards ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The albums still matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like the books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released an official statement in response to the question of Fox News contributor Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group was seen as a group of haters.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The network of Black Lives Matter is a love group," the movement's leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of showbiz figures, producers and media tycoons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met the Pope.</seg>

<seg id="9">And suddenly it is... I never even imagined it as it is... the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">Executive producer Kent UID met with journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and about why Britten, who first passed the track, will not receive any money prize.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.</seg>

<seg id="16">Thus, the lynching of the graves in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.</seg>
<seg id="17">It should be noted that during the last year the rates for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Economics of the Nobel laureate: Globalization</seg>
<seg id="2">Printing the processes of globalization should contribute to reducing inequality in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, the situation looks different, the income gap in developing economies is, on the contrary, rising.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Maskin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to remedy this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an enormous increase in global markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.</seg>
<seg id="8">Proponents of globalization have predicted big gains for emerging economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"And these are the forecasts in a lot of things," Maskin said.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, China and India have received serious per capita GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, not all are so rosy.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the "have-nots" and "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifest themselves in greater income inequality, and more precisely than pay for labor.</seg>
<seg id="13">But this disparity has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and cited NIE.</seg>
<seg id="14">In conjunction with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income gaps in poor countries are rising, like the MA.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are specific processes on the new global market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to demonstrate them, Maskin alters four skills of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="17">After globalization, experts from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">And, if lower-income workers from poor countries are growing up due to cooperation with the employees of the B from the rich, they do not feel either their wages down at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">The final effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and accordingly to increase the level of inequality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kremer and E. Maskin offer a surprisingly beautiful model, alternative to the rikardian theory of comparative advantage.</seg>
<seg id="21">It allows to explain why globalization has led to income inequality," said Fuad Alesorov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Solutions, the head of the Institute of Mathematics, NIU VSHE.</seg>
<seg id="22">And as any powerful theory is, I am sure that it will lead to an outbreak of empirical work in this area.</seg>
<seg id="23">The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, employees like the scientist do not have funds, and companies are not profitable to pay for their training.</seg>
<seg id="25">Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskin believes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The scientist points out that the developed theory does not, in any case, call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and yields fruit in the form of GDP growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Derbent: Live connection of times.</seg>
<seg id="2">Derbent - one of the most ancient cities of Russia - in September marks its 2000-anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the program of celebratory events - the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbentar carpets and the Day of open temples, the historical-musical show "2000 years for two hours" and excursions into the reconstructed Museum of Peter I.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabian inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, all seemed to be from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights."</seg>
<seg id="5">Derbent is the only Russian city that has preserved its place since ancient times.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazar Haganat and the Golden Horde were used to it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The age of the Eastern platans, which grow in the yard of the derbentian JUMA-METHETI, equals several centuries.</seg>
<seg id="8">These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Village - monuments of living nature."</seg>
<seg id="9">The shadow of the rafting will save pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.</seg>
<seg id="10">The visitors of the mosque will have an abundance of aromatic tea and carnivals of the Dagestani delicacy - copper figs, permafrost, mushmuth, leopstone wonderment, ayoon and sweetness.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Derbente, centuries are used by large males, in order for one time to drink tea of many guests.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inscription above the entrance to the Juma-mosque says the building is built in the 115 year of the hijra.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the most ancient mosque in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The interior is spectacular and solemn: The arcades of the domes and the vaults are based on square columns and illuminated by the sun rays from tiny windows.</seg>
<seg id="16">The contents and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbanta.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pet owners place the pigeons in the yards, under the trees, on the hatches.</seg>
<seg id="18">An exciting sight is a takeaway into the sky stacks of white doves similar to the flash of the festive fireworks display.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the defence against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.</seg>
<seg id="20">Having gone 500 meters into the sea, this building was locked in the harbour of Derbanta.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbanta were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification architecture.</seg>
<seg id="22">The carpets in Derbente flowed back to the 5th century, and up to today the technology of this unique craft remained almost unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="23">On one of the adjacent streets of the city street, carpets are sold on any taste - sticks of wool, cotton or felt of all colours and shades, with tequila and no one, with complex ornamentation and quirky kitty.</seg>
<seg id="24">The building of the town began with the maggots - the quarters with one-storey stone constructions.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Magpies have almost changed for years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in medieval but in the modern city.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the old part of town there are the details of a water pipe, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Our days have passed ancient sources, in which local people and now gather water.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many derbentans prefer regular water from the cranes of the tested historical fountains.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the motor craft's centres was located in Derbente.</seg>
<seg id="31">Polished and painted vases, dishes, pots and cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="32">The hands of the goncharov and now produce wonderful ceramic goods both practical and souvenir.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the days of celebrations and festivals, spectators gather under the strained canon, on which the students of the Republican school of circus art show.</seg>
<seg id="34">The history of remarkable and risky craftsmanship counts several centuries.</seg>
<seg id="35">The new trend - among the roosters' walkers are increasingly seen as girls.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbendent" is being held in the building of the former virgin bath today.</seg>
<seg id="37">Earlier here there were unmarried girls and the bride accompanied by a girlfriend, and now anyone can see a step-dome room, hot and cold swimming pools that have gone past bath accessories.</seg>
<seg id="38">In most of the houses there is a hot water, but the saunas and the parks are popular in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="39">The steam is written in ancient books about the benefits of heating of the body.</seg>
<seg id="40">After the bath improves blood, muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and ease.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the festival "The Commonwealth," which takes place in the territory of Naryn-Kala fortress, is taking part by the ethnocasings of many districts of Dagestan.</seg>
<seg id="42">The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk melodies and play songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors to tasty homemade cheese.</seg>
<seg id="43">Karachhlyr is a burial place of forty martyrs who have changed their heads for Islam.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is one of the most respected complexes for Muslims of the Northern Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="45">On the other hand, the sarcophagus are carved out of solid stone blocks and are oriented as to the Arabs, according to the axis of west east.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Gavril brothers and Albert Yakubovs shake up and break customers in a small cabin near the Upper Bazaar.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Barber has been in the area for many years.</seg>
<seg id="48">The techniques of circus craft are passed from generation to generation.</seg>
<seg id="49">Moreover, the Yakubovs brothers can do not only traditional but also the most modern hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="50">On one of the streets of the Old City the house was kept, in which lived referred to the Caucasus literature writer Alexander Bestuzov-Marlinsky.</seg>
<seg id="51">Having studied Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and bull citizens.</seg>
<seg id="52">Teakhouse is a traditional club of East where only tea and homemade pastries are served.</seg>
<seg id="53">Men come here to quell your thirst, talk to friends and solve some problems.</seg>
<seg id="54">As in previous times, women are not recommended to step in the tea area.</seg>
<seg id="55">Derbentsky dance ensemble "Caspian" was established three years ago, but has already taken part in the events of republican and Russian level.</seg>
<seg id="56">The soloists of the ensemble rehearse each day, learning in perfect folk avarian, Dargin, Tatar, Armenian dances.</seg>
<seg id="57">With the early evening, when the noise and incense of street lights are lit up, locals are racking up on an avalanche near houses with floor terraces.</seg>
<seg id="58">As a rule, the derbentans discuss household issues.</seg>
<seg id="59">But, on the eve of the anniversary they are increasingly recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, influenced by the fate of the entire Black and Caspian region.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is a new form of training in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.</seg>
<seg id="4">For this purpose the models of three airplanes were mounted in Domodedovo.</seg>
<seg id="5">The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served planes.</seg>
<seg id="6">All this is in the form of a business game, however, it has not yielded to reality.</seg>
<seg id="7">Late arrivals, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, the hunt lost somewhere along the road to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the real airport is hell.</seg>
<seg id="9">For those who have settled in the hangar of Domodedovo is a standard set of jobs that are to be solved by newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In one hangar there were three major airports from different countries of the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, there are four hundred students from university colleges and universities.</seg>
<seg id="12">An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the domestic world of aviagavani.</seg>
<seg id="13">Registration of passengers, service of airplanes, baggage turnover - they trust even the buses on the flight field, boards and screening of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="14">And the passengers are solid problem.</seg>
<seg id="15">One inordinate with the documents, another was late for a flight, a third filled bag of suspicious items.</seg>
<seg id="16">And deal with all this is necessary, as in life - in the minimum term.</seg>
<seg id="17">For each of these tasks they receive a certain amount, virtual cash, as if they have paid the corresponding amount for flight maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="18">"For failing to comply with their respective tasks, the penalty is charged," Financial analyst Dmitry Khilko said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="19">Officials from the Ministry of Education are following scrutiny.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Green Tribunal appeared to be quick at the crucifixion.</seg>
<seg id="2">Typical situation: Four officials stand in front of the desk judge Svatantaire Kumar, listening to his claims for the job.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.</seg>
<seg id="4">We didn't give you a 110-page order, so that you'll get over it," says Kumar.</seg>
<seg id="5">If there is another brick, we will show all the existing buildings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kumar leads the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - a judicial authority set up in 2010 to stem the rapid environmental pollution accompanying the tumultuous economic growth of recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="7">During that time, the Tribunal had examined more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological exploration, toxic waste and building dams.</seg>
<seg id="8">In two of the three cases, the court decides whether to stop the building leading to pollution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are incredibly high: For the incomplete 60 years since the announcement of the independence of intensified industrial development, India has become the country of the virgin jungle in one of the most crowded and polluted countries in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The problem is particularly acute in large mega cities, where infrastructure development does not lead to rapid urbanization: Cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining dwellings are cut under construction of new residential quarters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the formal support for the green movement on the part of the state, the NPR is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the abolition of major investment projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">So, in May this year, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible."</seg>
<seg id="13">Sometimes a court decision really cannot be executed in the given court date, confirms the lawyer for environmental affairs Radha Pandjwani.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, unfulfilled grandparents have a positive side: At least they are forcing the responsible people to move.</seg>
<seg id="15">"His main goal is to shake up this system," the lawyer added.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled the major construction projects: On its account the termination of the construction of the airport, power station and hundreds of smaller structures.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this case, people try not to forget, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, polluted by the local fluoride river.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.</seg>
<seg id="19">"People will lose jobs," commented Kumar's decision.</seg>
<seg id="20">But such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives can change thanks to a single scrap of referee pen.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, in April the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital than caused by public outrage.</seg>
<seg id="22">Despite the soaring popularity and shredding of criticism, Svatanter Kumar has refused to repeal the decision.</seg>
<seg id="23">Instead, he ordered a Delhi government to statistics on entering and travel vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 extra buses, having previously learned in the factories, whether they were able to perform a similar order.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the court's attention began to catch up with such sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, popular anger has begun to sharpen.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the most sick topic of the principal judge was the clean-up programme of the Ganges, with the pompous announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.</seg>
<seg id="26">When it comes to Ganga - sacred to the Indians of the river, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and passes on the cry.</seg>
<seg id="27">Do you know what the word "holy" means?</seg>
<seg id="28">Someone poured water from Ganga on the statue of God, and in it were feces.</seg>
<seg id="29">You continue to contaminate the river because you think: The Ganges are the Ganges, it will take all our sins.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's the river we worship and see what you do with it every day.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ganga's clearance is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.</seg>
<seg id="32">Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.</seg>
<seg id="33">Between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million merchants in it, Hindus die from infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="34">In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga rescue fund, bailed out of the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.</seg>
<seg id="35">Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: The suit was bought for $700,000, while clearing the river requires at least eight billion.</seg>
<seg id="36">Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India will have a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but does not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.</seg>
<seg id="37">"In a developing country, the talk about the environment is often perceived as an unbreakable luxury," said the activist of the organization "Zov Ganga" Malik Bkhanot.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the court tries to find a golden middle between ecology and development."</seg>
