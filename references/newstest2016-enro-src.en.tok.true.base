by mid-juli , it was 40 percent .
in earli august , it was 52 percent .

that 's a chang from when four in 10 place their money on jeb bush in late juli .

at this time last cycl , four in 10 republican pick rick perri to win the nomin , vs. onli 28 percent for eventu nomine mitt romney .
still , it show that a plural of gop voter see trump 's campaign as plausibl .
even if republican ralli around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some pundit point out that the splinter field is like contribut to trump 's lead , while anti-trump support is be spread diffus among more than a dozen other candid .

here 's what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will climb and the economi will slip into a recess .
this we know .
what we do n't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economi specif , histori offer littl guid about time .
a recess has come as quick as 11 month after the first rate hike and as long as 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , a determin in how the economi and financi asset respond .
that 's whi offici at the u.s. central bank have stress so vigor that investor should not be focus on when it start rais rate but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are , inde , multipl variabl at play .
in the end , howev , market particip may find that all the rate-hik fuss may have been overdon .
`` the first hike from the fed sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as signal the end of the era of cheap money , ' `` julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom , said in a note to client .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rate to more normal but still low level to be the seismic shock that mani seem to fear .
that 's not to say there wo n't be effect , howev .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi could react , base on histor trend :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip of rate hike can make thing volatil for a while .
onc the hike hit , though , the impact is not as dramat .
`` it doe seem there is a trend for equiti return to stall 12-24 month after the first hike , which again perhap reflect the lag in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi of what happen after the fed hike .
more specif , the market over the past 35 year or so is most often up sharpli - about 14 percent - head into the rate hike , fair flat in the 250 day after ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal onc 500 day have pass , with averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi bob doll , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , post on barron 's .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to get more pronounc later in the rate-hik cycl and return begin to diminish .
recess are a fact of econom life , but rate hike often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is face some condit that did not exist befor and could hasten a recess .
most notabl , gross domest product will be near it lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , in the 118 rate hike sinc 1950 , onli twice has nomin year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter track at just 1.5 percent , accord to the atlanta fed .
hike rate into such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and set up the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip have been brace for a fed hike all year , with all eye turn toward this week 's feder open market committe meet , which end thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv a hike at this meet , futur trade indic just a 25 percent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all hike cycl to date have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp eclips prerecess peak veri quick post the recoveri commenc , '' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest the fed has wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record had been 35 month , and this is 74 month and count .
fix incom also has been volatil as the market anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equiti experi .
the princip differ is that the impact happen faster in bond than stock when the fed chang cours in polici .
for bond , it doe seem yield chang direct immedi as the first hike/cut in the cycl arriv .
at the end of the hike cycl bond yield fall immedi , '' deutsch said .
charl schwab strategist believ the hike in rate will caus yield between longer- and shorter-d bond to move closer togeth , flatten the curv .
high-yield bond often perform better in such a climat , though `` we are still cautious about stretch for yield , '' kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab , said in an analysi .
interest , jone think market alreadi have adapt to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread have widen and volatil has increas - all characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad speak , compani that do the major of their busi in the u.s. will win as interest rate rise and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt will fare wors , as a rise dollar make their product more expens in the global market space and their debt more expens the financ .
`` histori show that qualiti ' stock tend to outperform dure the three month follow an initi rate hike , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report for client .
firm with strong balanc sheet outpac weak balanc sheet compani follow each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hike , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit as well as low volatil stock also outperform their lower qualiti counterpart , by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) , respect .
debt will becom a big issu .
compani with a high percentag of float rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outsid pure stock play , consum stand to benefit as well through the rise dollar .
saver could see gain as well through higher yield at the , though expert differ on how quick that will take hold .

advantag and disadvantag of the convers of loan in swiss franc
on the bank market two offer have alreadi appear for the convers in lei of loan in swiss franc , the main advantag be the exclus of currenc risk and decreas of instal .
disadvantag can come in a few year , when the variabl interest may lead to the increas of instal .
banca transilvania has just complet the convers process of swiss franc loan grant by volksbank and bancpost announc the convers offer for it client .
accord to the data gather by the analyst of the financi portal finzoom , bancpost offer a three-year fix interest rate for lei of 1.5 % , the lowest on the market .
on the other hand , the convers offer of banca transilvania was accept by 83 % of client with loan in franc due to two success reduct : the balanc with the amount of risk and manag fee paid by the client was reduc , and then a further reduct of 22.5 % was appli to the balanc in lei .
both offer reduc the instal of own client compar with the month payment paid in lei equival befor convers .
thus , banca transilvania reduc the instal by 42.5 % and bancpost , by 33 % in the first three year and , theoret , by 18 % in come year .
benefit
the main advantag of the convers in lei of chf loan is that it elimin currenc risk , the client be protect from futur increas of the franc and the loan repay will be made in the currenc in which it receiv it salari .
anoth majour advantag of both offer of convers is that a revalu of properti is not perform and addit guarante and anoth proof of incom are not requir .
basic , a new financi and legal analysi of the loan is not perform and addit cost in case of a refinanc will not be charg .
in addit , both bank offer a discount month instal , compar to how much client paid befor convers , in lei equival .
risk
the problem is that the instal in the first year is form most of interest and the client reimburs veri littl from the princip .
bancpost 's offer with a veri low interest in the first three year seem advantag to the client .
it is not known , howev , how this interest will evolv after three year .
the margin offer to the client may exceed 3.25 % , so the reduct of cost is lower .
a possibl risk for all loan in lei with a variabl interest is the fact that robor index may increas signific in the come year ( more than libor index - chf ) .
for exampl the current three month robor is 1.44 % , but in 2013 it had reach 6 % , in 2009 to over 15 % , and within a few day of 2008 it exceed 40 % !
in addit , it is possibl to have other cost , not mention in the initi offer .

van gaal said : `` he has a doubl leg fractur and is in hospit . ''
he will be transfer tomorrow or mayb a day later and then oper on in manchest .
it is aw - a boy who come to manchest unit at 18 , has it veri difficult and then play fantast and then this happen .
when it was in the dress room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was cri .
i am not a doctor but when you have a doubl fractur it is six month and he will not play in the group phase .
i hope he can play again this season .
moreno appear fortun to escap a red card and the concess of a spot-kick .
nicola rizzoli , the refere , did not penalis the mexican .
van gaal suggest the italian offici had er .
you can judg for yourself when i say it is a penalti and a red card .
it was a veri bad tackl with two leg .
a tweet on shaw 's account read : `` thank you everyon for your messag , word ca n't describ how gut i am , my road to recoveri start now , i will come back stronger . ''
relat : manchest unit suffer luke shaw blow in defeat at psv
the england defend will have an ad incent to recov with the european championship in franc next june .
phillip cocu , the psv coach , said : `` it 's a veri bad injuri . ''
if ani player goe off with this kind of injuri , everybodi is veri sad about it .
it is never the intent of our player to injur an oppon .

`` he find it veri difficult becaus the intent was not to injur the oppon , and when you hear it is a veri bad injuri , it 's not good , '' cocu said .
for me it was not possibl to see the moment .
the onli thing i could see was the ball , which was head in a differ direct , so it look like he [ moreno ] touch it , but i could n't see the tackl on luke .
speak to sbs6 , moreno said : `` i know how it feel , i know how difficult such a thing can be .
i feel veri bad about it , i am so sorri .

adam lyth was clear at risk of england omiss but it 's still tough
take on pakistan in the unit arab emir is a tough assign but after see the squad england have select for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat suffer last time doe not look on the card for me .
i would n't rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago but there are good player of spin in that bat lineup and the collect mindset is strong ; they will not carri scar from 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali is develop as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop from england test squad and replac by alex hale
the decis to omit adam lyth is obvious a tough one for me to analys as his head coach at yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are judg on output .
there were no question mark over joe root , for exampl , lead up to the announc becaus - and i have said this befor - player are their own best selector .
a coupl of half-centuri and lyth might have seen his run extend but he was in control of his own destini .
hope if he punch out more run for yorkshir anoth opportun will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud even when he was not perform as well as he can and that doe not surpris me ; he is a team man abov all els .
the question of how long a test batsman get to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven cap - like sam robson befor him - while nick compton got nine .
onli compton got the chanc home and away .
the onli gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wast opportun is in the past now .
alex hale come in and he is a batsman i rate high .
he is an x-factor cricket , which we at yorkshir saw earli this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch that was do a bit .
he must at least be afford the same opportun as those befor him but this will of cours depend on the make-up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen open the bat alongsid cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keep four quick , has been float and it is not someth i am against .
i do n't see whi a strokemak can not bat there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he is one hell of a cricket .
moeen may not have done the job for his counti , worcestershir , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much differ .
my old team-mat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop befor step up to open in 2001 .
he peel off three centuri immedi and did not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limit deal with him , he has struck me as veri impress young man .
peopl may look at his raw stat - averag 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a heap of spinner put their hand up and selector have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a coupl of shrewd addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the game 's loveliest bloke , who will bring a wealth of experi have done it in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood come in for the white-bal leg of the tour and will bring both energi and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i alway felt he was born to be involv in intern cricket , be it play or coach , and like mahela has nous that can be tap .
sometim new voic in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with what has been said befor , can freshen up a side .
colli 's durham team-mat ben stoke is rest for the one-day , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issu with this .
while not everyon will agre , the coach and selector do not set the schedul .
and you have to rememb , like player , their job are depend on result .
such decis are never taken light .
brexit camp might win the day if economi is in doldrum by 2017
david cameron 's half-bak renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu get deeper into troubl with everi day that pass , even without the elect of genial jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cut up rough over europ on tuesday .
foreign have their corbyn and nigel farag too .
a european diplomat chum explain the other day that , sunk in assort crise as the eu is - not all of their own make - some member state are fed up with britain 's self-absorb agenda of divis concess and disrupt treati chang which they most do n't want .
in brighton for it annual bean , the tuc decid it did n't want them either if they erod social protect .
we could even call it dave and georg 's selfi agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summit or bilater session in foreign capit , take a photo of themselv in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grande , then come home and say they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european pal , who want an outward-look britain insid the eu tent - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that more short-sight minist and offici in some capit have got to the point where they do n't care whether we stay or leav .
angela merkel , germani 's cautious level-head chancellor , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year and want to leav offic befor it goe bad for her , as it did for overstay thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
franc 's françoi holland is face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
he is a fade forc too .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern of the right , spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them break a leg to help the selfi brit , whose energi might be better spent prevent scotland leav the uk - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some such minist may even be plan to make deliber unhelp remark , snp-style , dure the uk 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggest .
`` the renegoti was a fix '' and `` britain got noth of valu out of the renegoti . ''
the european know to their cost how predatori fleet street can be and how eu-scept the oligarch press baron are , as they were not dure the toni benn-inspir 1975 referendum which endors our 1973 entri by a ratio of 2:1 .
they may dim rememb bori johnson , the arch euro-opportunist , make his name as an `` eu straight banana '' brussel correspond in the earli 90s .
for all his foolish ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
they includ the medley of tax-shi rascal , phone-hack foreign and pseudo non-dom who own most of our great newspap .
actual toni blair thought much the same about them , but realis that when you re in a cage with a randi gorilla you have to pass the banana to distract it from have you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairit than blair in oppos cameron 's referendum wheez , sinc blair had conced the principl over the eu 's abort constitut , sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgav him that either .
but nice jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back at westminst on monday - i told him he no longer has time to wast on me - seem to be in danger of re-adopt neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of the 80s , a mistak then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coher strategi to engag with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacat on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit on europ is what i will kind call evolv .
he say he 'd like us to stay in a reform eu .
well , most peopl outsid ukip 's woad-wear tendenc and the wilder shore of tori littl englander can probabl say yes to that .
it 's what hilari `` a benn , but not a bennit '' benn said on radio and tv this week as the boy scout in him struggl not to admit that corbyn 's appoint of abras john mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it remind me of the 70s , when his old dad struggl on tv to be disloy to labour cabinet colleagu without go too far and lose his cabinet job .
hilari 's struggl was more attract .
but fight to stay in `` in all circumst '' - benn 's phrase - was not what mcdonnel was say , nor what jc told peer and mps at their privat meet on monday night , by all account .
whatev the bottom-up , touchy-fe imag corbyn want to convey - rememb , he even touch me - messag disciplin remain import in the age of 24/7 tv and especi in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it 's fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europ , allow him to take labour 's support for grant in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel has said .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnel and corbyn 's basic equivoc about eu membership - consist with their bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among leftw dissid for whom the narciss of small differ is a central tenet of doctrin squabbl .
as with his equivoc over nato - tom watson is adam that jc wo n't campaign to quit - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to make sens of it all for their master at home .
whi should pari or berlin wast polit capit - they have suspici voter too - on concess to britain when it may all be pointless ?
the us is alreadi pretti disappoint with the brit '' feebl militari perform in iraq , libya and syria , even with a cost-cut tori govern in power , as i was remind at the launch of someth call the british influenc secur forum on monday .
expert criticis public health england e-cigarett review
claim by a government-fund agenc that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke aros from a meet of 12 peopl , some with link to the tobacco industri , research have said .
expert write in the british medic journal ( bmj ) join the lancet in criticis the evid use by public health england ( phe ) in it report on e-cigarett .
phe publish the `` landmark '' report last month , describ it as a `` comprehens review of the evid . ''
but sever research have question the robust of the data and point to link between some expert and the tobacco industri .
an editori in the lancet medic journal last month attack the `` extraordinarili flimsi foundat '' on which phe base it main conclus .
write in the bmj , two further research have question whether the claim were `` built on rock or sand . ''
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
they said the public would expect phe 's claim that `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' would be base on a detail review of evid and model .
in fact , it come from a singl meet of 12 peopl conven to develop a multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) model to synthesis their opinion on the harm associ with differ nicotine-contain product ; the result of the meet were summaris in a research paper .
mckee and capewel said one sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose chief execut was report to have previous receiv fund from british american tobacco for an independ studi .
he also endors bat 's public health credenti in a sustain report , they said .
one of the 12 peopl at the meet declar fund from an e-cigarett manufactur but not the fund he was report to have receiv previous from the tobacco compani philip morri intern , they ad .
the rational for select the member of the panel is not provid , but they includ sever known e-cigarett champion , some of whom also declar industri fund in the paper .
some other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
the meet was also attend by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produc by the group `` tell conced '' there is a lack of `` hard evid for the harm of most product on most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or limit are discuss in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe 's claim that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett are act as a rout into smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had been respond to befor .
he said : `` e-cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one in two lifelong smoker die from their addict .
all of the evid suggest that the health risk pose by e-cigarett are small by comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what it doe not show , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die of a smoking-rel ill and smoke cost the nhs £2bn a year .
by spell out clear the current evid - that while e-cigarett are not risk-fre , they carri onli a fraction of the harm caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation remit .

the french violinist david grimal is one of the great artist of our time , known not onli as a soloist but also as the initi of an unusu , downright `` weird '' project , as he himself say , les disson - an orchestra compos of intern soloist and talent musician , who play a symphon repertoir without have a conductor , and this make it a curios , to say the least , in the classic music scene .
les disson particip this year with two show in the enescu festiv : a perform on sunday , in which the soloist was david grimal , founder of the orchestra , and one on monday , when the cellist xavier phillip was in the forefront , the work of enescu be an indispens and customari element of the event .
both perform on the stage of the athenaeum , show the audienc a differ way of interpret classic music .
les disson appear on the music scene in 2004 , at that time be the onli classic music ensembl with no conductor .
the conductor is the most import musician for the other musician .
it is true that musician need an educ to becom either soloist or perform in an orchestra - here we are talk about instrumentalist and not compos .
they are train as `` special worker '' .
they themselv feel they need to have a conductor .
on the other side of the stage , for the public , all the music fetish focus on the conductor .
and so , the busi , the music industri , market itself .
therefor , we are no longer talk about music .
`` so if we look at this world , on the one hand we have skill worker , which is stupid , and on the other hand we have a public that can not listen , but must look instead , which is again stupid , '' say david grimal .
the violinist say that this chang in the way he make music was the result of the `` music decept '' in his solo career .
i was like a profession athlet who had to do the same exercis in differ orchestra around the world , to earn money and to bring money into the music industri .
10 year ago , when i was around 30 year old , i found this thing to be veri depress becaus it could not find the creativ and human brotherhood in this system .
so , i had no reason to continu on this path .
this is the moment i decid to creat les disson .
this happen in 2004 , and at that time nobodi was do this kind of thing without a conductor : `` the music world was veri conserv and did not want this kind of project . ''
`` how do you imagin you could market a group of musician which has no ego ? '' ask the artist .
david grimal admit that les dissonac is `` a luxuri '' , ad that none of the musician who are part of the orchestra doe not depend on the success of this project to make a live .
in the 10 year of exist of this group , the absenc of a conductor did not prove to be an obstacl for the music act : `` curious , the more we play a more complex repertoir , the simpler it seem , becaus all the musician are oblig to be present in the work and not just in the role , '' say grimal , ad that the show on sunday `` had 74 conductor on stage. ``
in grimal 's opinion , the enescu festiv is `` veri brave '' just becaus les disson were among the guest : `` a great festiv , featur the greatest orchestra in the world which perform even 3 time a day , and in the midst of these orchestra you also invit this strang group . ''
in a templ of the orchestr tradit , as is the enescu festiv , there is a the place and interest for someth differ , which break barrier .
speak about the work of enescu , the violinist admit he feel the music the famous romanian compos , so he did not feel the need for a special approach when he introduc some of enescu 's work in his repertoir .
grimal note that enescu 's music is veri instinct , but that happen when you talk about georg enescu and romanian music , `` becaus there is a georg enescu who compos french music . ''
grimal strive to chang the way in which the classic music educ is carri out , consid that `` be a musician , as this activ is organ today , has a tast of death '' and that `` the futur of music is the music itself . ''
we do not need to do a world tour 5 time a year if it doe not serv anyth .
in bach 's era there were no world tour .
beethoven , brahm , bartok , enescu were work peopl , artist , and not commerci repres .
for me , organ concert , festiv , tour , releas album , they are all are formid , extraordinari , but as long as they are in the servic of music .
if not , we are part of a system where creativ suffer , no longer has freedom .
to illustr this phenomenon , david grimal gave the exampl of romanian product befor and after eu access : `` in romania , befor enter the eu , your veget and meat were good . ''
to join the eu you had to adopt health law which are not good for veget and meat .
agricultur and product end up in the servic of the supermarket , the same way it 's happen in franc .
the same thing happen with music , it 's the same logic .
les disson make tomato which are not particular good look , but you cut them they are verit tomato .
in an ideal world , this music should be onc again be in focus , and the institut and industri which manag this system should understand that music doe not need to be sold , but need to be share , and this may be achiev start with the educ polici .
`` if we were to believ - as do the korean , the chines , the japanes - that western music is one of the most beauti thing of human , we would reintroduc it teach in school , we would reintroduc the concert on televis and through this educ we would no longer need to sell music by-product '' , said grimal .
certain , there are thing in classic music educ which remain veri communist . this can be found everywher , is a veri militar phenomenon .
it depend on the disciplin if you compar a musician to a soldier , or if we train a musician to play an instrument , who will be a musician , abov all .
we are talk about a complet differ educ . if we want to train a soldier ( this educ - red.n . ) , the train must be conduct in a certain way , if we want to train a musician , we are talk about someth els .
in your opinion , who is more danger , a soldier or a musician ? `` , ask the french artist smile .
grimal show that for artist , to reward a differ way of make music come from overcom the `` soldier '' status , overcom `` the limit impos by oneself '' : `` in a certain moment , musician discov that they are not soldier , and therefor leav the concert smile . ''
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision for the music and the artist in the `` festiv of idea '' , a public discuss organ by the romanian aspen institut dure the georg enescu intern festiv .

fedex corp. said that it expect to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year that end next may , down 20 cent from an earlier predict .
analyst expect $ 10.84 , accord to a survey by factset .
the reduc outlook come despit rate hike averag 4.9 percent , which will take effect jan. 4 , and higher surcharg for ground shipment of heavi or larg packag , which begin in novemb .
the compani said it still expect earn to grow over the previous year becaus of cost-cut , higher revenu and growth in onlin commerc .
chairman and ceo fred smith said the compani was `` perform solid given weaker-than-expect econom condit , especi in manufactur and global trade . ''
the holiday-hir plan were announc a day after rival up said that that it plan to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra worker , about the same that it hire last year .
in the quarter that end aug. 31 , fedex earn $ 692 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .

six analyst survey by zack expect $ 12.23 billion .
fedex has been hit in recent year by a declin in prioriti intern ship , which has caus revenu in it express unit to stagnat .
but the boom in onlin shop has boost result at fedex ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenu rose 29 percent but oper incom was basic flat on higher cost for larger packag and self-insur .
the express unit saw higher incom becaus of higher base rate , while incom fell in the freight busi on higher labor cost .
in premarket trade about an hour befor the open bell , fedex share were down $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
they close tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on june 11 .
at their most anticip meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week seat around a 27-foot honduran mahogani tabl decid if it 's time to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
loom over them at one end of the central bank 's ornat , two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to put the nation 's econom interest abov all other .
the central bank has a dual charg from congress : maxim u.s. employ and keep price here stabl .
but sinc the great recess , fed leader have acknowledg that there 's an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and that third mandat could be the x-factor in a too-close-to-predict decis , to be announc thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to start be wean from the unpreced stimulus provid by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
even though most data show the economi grow solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market could make already-cauti fed offici skittish about ad to the volatil by rais their benchmark feder fund rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious the labor market and inflat is go to be first and foremost the most import thing they watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais the rate , the increas uncertainti surround the global marketplac is enough to provid them with justif to wait further , '' she said .
there 's no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is caus financi market jitter .
about half of economist survey recent by bloomberg predict a rate increas this week .
financi market , howev , are expect the fed to hold off , with a key indic show onli about a 30 % chanc of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed rais the rate , unless policymak were to soften the blow by promis that anoth increas would be a way off .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228.89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that fed policymak will hold the rate steadi this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed hike rate at this point in time , '' he said .
if fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to great length in their polici statement to hold financi market ' hand so they do n't panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seem on track to rais the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would valid the strength of the u.s. recoveri .
yellen had said through the spring and earli summer that she expect a rate increas this year despit complaint from liber that more econom progress was need .
although job creation slow in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate drop to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year and near the level the fed consid to be full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and although inflat continu to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , fed policymak said a key reason was the temporari effect of sharpli lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate , and need them , given the tight of the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world start convuls late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag drop as much as 16 % below it record high in may as investor fear a slow chines economi would drag down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , with the dow now down near 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymak , the market turmoil add to the complex calculus of when to rais the interest rate .
`` absent what happen in financi market and the news about the weak in the chines economi over the past coupl week , they would be tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he predict they ll wait at least a month to get a better handl on the effect .
`` there 's a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the u.s. economi are go to be , and they have almost no data to reli on that post-dat the develop in china , '' olin said .
the health of the global economi is n't one of the fed 's primari concern , so technic it should n't be factor into it decision-mak .
but , in effect , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint by then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed might `` taper '' it monetari expans trigger market convuls around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , fed offici can be expect not onli to monitor the develop elsewher but also to consult with other central banker and expert to get a better read on the global economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of overreact to financi market movement that seem unconnect to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe who has been push for a rate increas , cite decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
a financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over three meet `` despit limit identifi implic for u.s. growth , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici revers those cut .
the fed should put financi stabil concern first onli dure a major crisi , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's rate-set committe .
the latest turmoil doe n't come close to that level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be put in a situat of be scare of a rate hike becaus market got upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv act still has the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that is chang , i do n't think they should get ahead of the curv .

whi i 'm a wit at an execut in oklahoma
later today , bar a late legal intervent , i will watch a man be put to death .
if it happen , and i hope it wo n't , i will sit in a view galleri in the death chamber at oklahoma state penitentiari as richard glossip is execut by lethal inject .
he has ask me to be one of four offici wit to his death .
the invit was first made back in januari , via his best friend , and though i was shock , i agre .
as the day approach , i ve come to dread it .
so whi do it ?
i agre becaus i thought it was a good way of tell the full stori about the death penalti .
it would offer a uniqu perspect .
true , journalist are permit to watch execut in america and becaus there are often more applic than seat avail , a macabr lotteri take place to decid who will be chosen .
oklahoma has reduc the number of media seat from 12 to five .
whoever is pick will watch it dispassion .
i can not do that .
i will be sit alongsid richard glossip 's closest friend , and i have develop my own relationship with him through month of phone call , and one visit last two-and-a-half hour .
i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison author say i can not be both a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be allow a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to tri to rememb all the detail .
one oklahoma journalist accus me on twitter of compromis my imparti .
here 's the lesson .
tell the inmat 's stori the way he like it , get access .
i complain to her .
she admit that she `` could have phrase it better , '' but still think i 'm wrong to do what i 'm do .
richard glossip has taken issu with some of the thing i ve said and written .
he doe n't tell me what to write , and i would n't do it even if he did .
i ve told him he can remov me from his list of wit at ani time .
but he want an intern report to be there to write about it .
if he die , he think the public will help the anti-death penalti movement .
kim bellwar , a report from the huffington post , will be alongsid me .
if you want to know more about the case , pleas listen to the seri of podcast i ve made .
i wo n't go over all the detail again here .
i can not say with certainti that richard glossip is innoc .
his action after the murder of barri van trees would make him guilti of be an accessori after the fact .
but i believ there is a strong probabl that he is not guilti of murder .
i certain believ there was not enough evid to justifi a death sentenc .
i believ his execut is wrong .
and it 's from this perspect that i will watch him die .
i can not claim to be truli object .
there will be other report you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man i like die an unnecessari death .

`` that keep come up - i did n't hear trent robinson bring up wrestl when they beat us 24-2 , '' bellami said on wednesday .
i can guarante we have n't chang noth all year with our defens system or techniqu , it 's just that the last six week we have made a real emphasi with our contact in tackl and that has been the turn around for us .
trent has been there three year and he obvious has a great side to coach so he is probabl not use to lose so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it 's funni how this alway come up at this time of year .

but now he has a team which can play what we would see as excit footi , especi his young halv with their speed .
that 's the footi you would want to play when you have those sort of player .
he made that point in 2010 , now he want everyon to play his style of footi - not everi team has two halv like anthoni milford and ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it build more confid becaus they are say these thing becaus they are a littl bit concern about play us .
six week ago they probabl were n't think of us when they get to the big game .

the bronco game was probabl a good game , i have n't watch it yet but what was the score ? 16-12 ?
our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tri in our game but is that excit footi ?
or is it make break and not score tri that is excit ?
to me it 's agenda .
if they are mention us it mean that at some stage we might meet them there .

how hagi silenc complain
consid by mani the greatest romania footbal player in histori , gica hagi , was label after his retir as a weak coach who is not abl to achiev high perform in the new posit .
after unfortun experi with the nation team , steaua and galatasaray , hagi took over a year ago the coach posit for viitorul constanta , the team he own .
after exact one year after take over the team , the king prove that he is abl to transform a team that was struggl to save itself from releg into a top one .
so after one year , viitorul record with hagi as a coach , 16 victori , 11 tie and 11 defeat .
the balanc is one of a top team fight in the european cup .
thing have taken a turn for the better for viitorul dure this season , as the team came in second place in the nation leagu with 19 point , one point less than the leader astra giurgiu .
viitorul also has the best attack in the nation leagu with 20 goal ( at a tie with astra ) , more than doubl than steaua .
on the other hand , even if he brought more experienc player to the team , hagi continu it polici to promot young footbal player , and late the start team includ name like iani hagi or hodorogea .
the club 's polici made viitorul a team to be watch by foreign team , and so hagi has sold this summer in the amount of 1.5 million euro - iani hagi ( fiorentina - 1 million euro ) and alexandru mitrita ( bari - 500 thousand euro ) .
along with steaua , viitorul is the onli profit team from the nation leagu , accord to the inform from the trade regist .
in the refuge crisi , romania has play the role of a small countri so far .
this is a legitim strategi , but then you can not ask to be treat as the seventh countri of the eu .
larg countri shall come up with solut for the entir eu , said cristian ghinea , a member of the board of director of the romanian centr for european polici .
in an interview given to ziare.com , cristian ghinea has state that europ can not be transform into a fortress and pure polic mean will not work in this crisi : `` mayb we have doubt about the qualiti of valu of these peopl . ''
but there are mass that have embark on a path and we can not undo histori .
migrat is a realiti to which we must adapt better but we must also adapt migrant to us .
in cristian ghinea 's opinion , we live in a high emot moment in which the politician feel the need to show their muscl .
after it pass , european will be will to give up the freedom of movement , but the rule govern the schengen area must be chang : `` schengen is now like an anim creat in anoth era and which was has not adjust to the current situat . ''
what is our posit in the refuge crisi after this jha council which actual solv noth ?
it is clear that the ec presid in agreement with donald tusk did not want to forc a vote within the council .
all the forecast say they had the necessari vote .
befor the lisbon treati , the jha appli the principl of unanim and ani state could block ani decis .
therefor , veri littl was integr in justic and home affair .
after lisbon , the normal procedur appli , the ec has the initi , and the council approv it with the vote of 55 % of the countri , name 16 , which repres 65 % of the eu popul .
the calcul state that the vote exist .
but they did not want to go forward .
becaus it 's a sensit issu , even germani reject chancellor merkel 's polici of open and did not want other countri to see it as : `` eu thrust migrant upon us '' .
the matter was therefor postpon , but the problem remain becaus obvious this wave creat a huge problem for the schengen govern and we will like see big chang in the next period .
mandatori quota were not realli remov , but was the subject onli allow to further cool down ?
yes , on the other hand , tongu are wag about greater involv of the frontex agenc in the manag of extern border , which mean a shift of respons from the individu member countri found near schengen 's outer border to the communiti agenc .
greec 's border with turkey is actual germani 's border with turkey , and this wave of migrant prove to be the limit for the old schengen system .
mayb the dublin principl will be drop becaus it is not sustain . this principl state that migrant are the respons of the state in which they have enter first .
if greec overturn , you can not indefinit sustain it 's greec 's deal .
this is a common problem .
precis becaus this is a common problem , is it possibl to fix it without a precis mechan , perhap even a share mandatori effort to receiv the migrant ?
no one know exact how the mandatori quota will work , if it come to this .
a question still remain unansw : what do you do with a man who doe not want to come to romania or portug , but instead want to go to sweden or germani ?
i do not think the european state will rush at the migrant : you will go to countri x or countri y .
perhap it will come to the creation of some uniqu filtrat centr in greec or in turkey where the refug applic will be process .
these kind of solut are be conceiv .
but the problem doe not have a simpl solut .
there are countri that have decad of experi in tri to integr migrant , there are countri with no experi as is the case of romania , where the problem of migrant will increas xenophob trend .
the fact is that we are talk about million of peopl in turkey , lebanon , jordan , live in precari camp and who are just begin to head toward europ .
one estim say that onli 10 % have manag to leav becaus it is hard cross the mediterranean dure winter , but next year we expect an even bigger migrat wave .
what about these peopl ?
my predict is that we ll get use to this problem and it will not seem so catastroph in term of media coverag .
you were talk about more or less experienc countri .
doe it seem like there are some place that have realli manag to integr larg group come from a non-european cultur ?
i see the maghrebian in franc , turk in germani , they are also landlock .
i would not make radic statement .
of cours , their integr is more difficult than other wave of migrat , but that doe not mean they are not integr at all .
there are still some who remain unintegr , creat majour social problem in franc , germani , uk .
but pure polic mean will not work .
to creat a fortress out of europ is an illusori concept .
we have to develop the mechan of integr in european societi .
some mistak have been made in this area .
we must be more demand .
we must ask these peopl to learn the languag , tri to appropri our valu , to stop have one foot in europ and one in their home countri , bring the rest of the famili includ through marriag of conveni .
howev , we must separ the immin problem creat by these peopl from the long term problem of their integr .
if other have fail in long-term integr that doe n't mean that we have to watch them drown in the mediterranean .
mayb we have doubt about the qualiti of valu of these peopl .
and if there is go to be an intervent in syria , which i do n't think will ever happen , that doe not mean that the countri will recov overnight and you can send them back .
until solut are creat , we will see fortress in europ .
the border are close , wall are be risen , border control are be reintroduc in the schengen area .
is the european project be threaten ?
the european project per se is not , but the former organis form of the schengen area is .
it was built quit minimalist and it rule put too much pressur on the countri in which these migrant step foot in for the first time .
i mean we are free to rove , but each with their own problem .
we can not continu like this when we are face with this migrat wave , becaus some countri can not handl it .
when these kind of emot wave aris , politician want to show that they are do someth , but in the long run not much is chang .
after the attack in franc we do not have a much more draconian anti-terrorist legisl in the eu than we had last year .
it 's a wave of public emot that goe both way .
the emot is so unstabl from one week to anoth that you can not base your decis on it .
we hear discuss , more bellicos statement from politician who are at home and feel the pressur of be viril .
and then , the dramat case of the child that drown in turkey happen and strike a chord in the public opinion .
after the public emot pass , we will return to the reason we have creat this space , the freedom of movement that is not onli for peopl but also for good .
this is the true singl european market .
and i do not think that the european will give up this principl of freedom of movement .
the fact that there are go to be differ rule is a total differ thing .
schengen is now like an anim creat in anoth era and which was has not adjust to the current situat .
what was romania 's role in this crisi so far ?
as a small countri , romania believ that if it cover it eye and ear , the situat will disappear .
in the realiti of migrat wave , you can choos to be part of the solut or say that this is not your problem as a small countri .
this was our polici and it 's a legitim strategi , but then you can not ask to be treat as the seventh countri of the eu .
if you are not involv , you can not be treat as other big countri .
big countri come up with solut for the entir eu , good or bad , we are not discuss their qualiti now .
as did poland .
on the other hand , the effect of this crisi is that the romanian ' appetit for schengen will great decreas .
presid iohanni say that mayb it 's a good thing that romania is not yet part of schengen .
so we find ourselv in a transit from the despair to join to a more pragmat posit , but the goal still remain .
if romania and bulgaria join schengen , there is of cours the risk to be consid as an altern rout by the migrant .
this is not a reason for not join schengen , but a reason to be more pragmat .
romania will be part of schengen and the schengen will exist , but it will be transform in the sens that the extern border will becom common respons , there will be uniqu rule of accept of the migrant , uniqu rule of deport for those who do not receiv refug , uniqu rule for countri consid safe .
the ukrainian presid state that after russia shift it attent to syria , there were no more death in the ukrain .
is there a link between the two outbreak , one of russia 's game ?
russia behav like a frustrat power .
it believ that be a great power mean mislead american and european .
from this point of view , yes , there is a connect .
without the financi and militari effort of the putin regim , the assad regim would like have collaps long ago .
it crash would have been a good thing if it happen befor it main oppon becam the islam state .
a battl between the assad regim and the laic and moder muslim militia , back by the gulf and western countri , was fought for a coupl of year .
then the islam state has risen and we no longer know if we want the assad regim to fall .
russia could have complic thing , but can not particip in the solut .
it creat instabl and chao outbreak which it can not bring to an end .
you are a great power onli if you have solut .
the off-sid play is just a strategi to save time .
perhap putin expect to receiv offer , to press button in order to resolv the situat .
the offer do not come becaus the rest of the world is not convinc that he can solv the issu creat by him one way or anoth .
but i do not agre with the theori that say that these peopl are driven by an invis hand .
let 's not look at putin and see him stronger than he actual is .

the magistr of iasi counti settl the first hear in a close session in which the seven youth were accus of rape a young woman age 18 , request to be set free .
befor start the actual hear , one of the judg from iasi counti who had been assign the case , viorel munteanu , made a request for abstent , which was accept by his colleagu .
the magistr work until this summer at vaslui court , where he was the presid of the crimin section , and he is the one who , on april 9 admit an appeal brought by four of the defend , order their placement under hous arrest .
current , the case is judg by a panel that includ the magistr maricica mititelu and geta sandu .
judg dan anton also made a request for abstent earlier in the case , becaus his daughter is in a relationship of cohabit with one of the rapist ' lawyer .
the two judg decid that the rapist from vaslui should remain in custodi .
the young men will remain imprison for at least 30 day , period after which the judg will re-discuss the possibl of set them free .
the next hear will be held at the court of appeal of iasi counti on octob 6 .
befor arriv at the court of appeal of iasi , the van transport the rapist from vaslui was involv in an accid in păcurari district as the car was enter iasi citi through the beltway .
the iveco van that transport the seven rapist was hit by a volkswagen that came from canta street whose driver tri to turn left .
the van was come from the end of păcurari .
the car came this way becaus the prison administr employe prefer the rout from vaslui to iasi which pass the locat of grajduri and then they enter on the beltway .

the great migrat
romania is not nor will it be ever be readi for what come next .
what about europ ?
i 'm go to say this from the begin , loud and clear : the approxim 7,000 refuge who should be and have to be naturalis by romania is in itself an insignific number , but a huge one compar to the capac of the romanian state to manag this kind of project .
for romania , even the voluntari quota propos by bucharest , amount to about 1,500 soul , surpass by far our good intent of solidar with the european union express in recent month .
certain , if those migrant will accept to settl in our citi , the chanc of a quick integr in the romanian societi are extraordinarili small .
i am convinc that they will be the first to lose their patienc .
suck dri by the parasit of the underworld gang and by a venal polit class , the romanian state prove to be impot in all area .
failur to integr the gypsi is just a trivial exampl .
besid , govern of ani colour were not abl to absorb european fund to build road , kindergarten or modern school , provid decent health care , collect the garbag of the street , creat decent paid job or prevent it young generat from leav the countri .
whi would a refuge settl in a countri similar to the one he 's run away from ?
but what is particular surpris is the hypocrisi display when deal with such a crisi .
first , we come into contact with the hypocrisi of the bellicos power countri of the eu , which are especi generous when it come to share their troubl with smaller countri .
the second thing is the romanian ' hypocrit fear . although romanian have million of relat scatter all over the world , they still do not accept the person next to them - the one speak a differ languag , have a differ religion or just becaus he has differ blood run through his vein .
we are probabl afraid that someon will steal our nation ident .
in the end , there is the hypocrisi of mani migrant who , although onli invok the horror of war as a reason for leav , do not accept anoth destin of their exodus other than germani or the nordic countri .
howev , not all refuge are syrian , and pakistan is not at war .
furthermor , the simpl way of analys the crisi can onli be derid .
some argu that the caus must be elimin strict reli on polit correct , ask for peac and invest in the migrant ' home countri .
but romania is at peac and occasion , some foreign capit is inject in the nation economi - but that doe not prevent ten of thousand of romanian from leav the countri everi year .
whi do they leav ?
in this crisi , the european union has reveal to be a stiff , divid and overwhelm structur .
we express critic about the fact that romania is not abl to invent a project for the countri , but we see that the eu also doe n't have ani plan for the futur .
improvis and threat will not help .
consid the abov , what is the use of the eu , if the onli advantag enjoy by the romanian - freedom of movement - could be call into question becaus of the wave of refuge cross border with no effort whatsoev ?
at one point , the war in syria will end .
the migrant crisi will not .
in the follow decad , overpopul , poverti , climat chang , resourc deplet , etc . will push million of desper migrant from asia and especi africa to a better life .
with such politician , romania is not nor will it be ever be readi for what come next .

meanwhil , the girl was transfer to the hospit in iași and when the father came back he could n't find her .
i think almost nine month had pass sinc the girl was hospit .

becaus of financi problem , the grandmoth could not go with crina to iași and the girl remain in the care of the doctor .
becaus dure all this time nobodi came to ask about the fate of the child , she was taken by the general director of social assist and child protect in iași , who then gave her to the foster care centr in bucium .
dure that period , abandon and adopt were more light regul in comparison to today 's regul in romania .

they fell in love with blond crina , and after some time she move to itali with them .
the littl girl had turn almost two when the adopt formal were complet .

we pray to god to keep her safe .
i thought of her all the year , but we did not have the possibl to find her .

howev , even if the year pass , the parent from ruginoasa were never forgotten .

corbyn , the brexit and the futur of europ
due to econom and demograph reason , the prosper enjoy in the last decad can not continu in the come year .
by saturday , probabl few peopl in romania knew who jeremi corbyn is .
even today , after he becam the new leader of the labour parti in britain , mani are ask to what extent can we be affect by the choic of a politician who , after all , is not in a posit to take decis .
jeremi corbyn is the most radic leftist leader of the labour parti after the war .
avow marxist , anti-monarchist ( at one point he ask toni blair , then prime minist , to elimin the royal famili from buckingham palac ) , a fierc anti-american and a support of vladimir putin ( he was otherwis a regular guest of the `` russia today '' televis channel , and he would comment polit event ) . he is also a support of the hezbollah and hama terrorist movement and want britain to give up nuclear weapon and withdraw from nato and the eu .
at the time , corbyn thought that the kill of osama bin laden was a true tragedi and isi was almost to be prefer in comparison to the unit state .
as all populist demagogu , corbyn has , of cours , anti-auster miracl solut .
these kind of thing were also said and promis by tsipra in greec until he came to close quarter with the real world and econom standard .
the econom program of the new labour parti leader provid , among other , massiv renationalis and money print as a solut for project regard financ develop and coverag of generous social benefit .
sure , some might ask whi the money print solut is not wide adopt around the globe . we would then have a general worldwid prosper ! , but who is go to beat his brain with such detail .
sure we can bleed white the banker , who becam a kind of usual enemi of the left wing , but from what we have seen so often in the past , this thing have happen not onli in the former communist countri or ecuador or venezuela , but also in franc , at the begin of mitterrand and holland 's mandat .
addit amount are quick swallow by generous unsubstanti pledg , made by populist demagogu .
as margaret thatcher use to warn , `` the problem of social is that , at some point , you run out of other peopl 's money '' .
few give jeremi corbyn a real chanc to ever becom prime minist .
in the earli 80s anoth radic leftist leader , michael foot fail miser in the elect . his belief were not as extrem as the one of the newli elect parti leader .
but great britain still has a work class in the classic sens of the word , relat consist and structur .
union were signific more influenti than they are now .
under the new industri landscap , where all servic are domin in the workforc regard as a whole , and extens autom has led to an industri that need massiv high qualifi manpow , corbyn 's rhetor has limit appeal .
but even as part of the opposit , he can influenc import develop that may affect us direct .
in it latest issu , the financi time believ that corbyn 's elect increas the chanc of brexit or the withdraw of great britain from the eu .
the new labour parti leader has been a consist oppon of the countri 's membership in the european union .
in the eye of the radic left wing , brussel is an agent of intern capit and a promot of globalis which impos auster to the poor .
when you combin this with the kind of idea with the one express by the radic right and the anti-immigr rhetor and you look at the refuge crisi that shake up the eu , you get an explos mix .
and this is not valid onli for the unit kingdom .
but if the british decid to leav the european union as a result of the referendum , which would take place befor 2017 , the loss of symbol capit for the entir european project and the deep fault line creat within the eu by the euro crisi and recent by that of the refuge , between north and south , between east and west , this leav room for the most worri scenario .
the more so , sinc london has been a counterweight to the franco-german axi ( in which berlin is becom an increas domin player ) for a number of member state .
it 's true that the british busi environ , the citi , are strong advoc for remain a member of the eu .
but the europ of today is not what it use to be .
resent is current grow in intens .
the recent speech of jean clude junker also reveal a problem which is that brussel increas tend to make majour decis without consult the great major of member state , ask for the opinion of just a few european power , main germani .
this is happen while the elector support for anti-system , anti-immigr parti which are euroscept at the same time , increas dramat across the contin .
in other word , negat charg emot climat has reach level higher than ever befor .
henc the conclus that was drawn by the financi time when assess the chanc of brexit .
the pro-eu option is base on a cold calcul depart from nation interest .
if the voter will take the decis use their brain , then great britain will remain in the eu .
but corbyn 's victori remind us of the power of emot in the polit of today .
or , eastern europ can be signific affect by such majour develop .
as expect , this will happen especi if we will see a more pronounc integr of the eurozon , which will push most of the state in the region to the outskirt of interest and to the decision-mak process in europ .
corbyn , tsipra and syriza in greec , podemo in spain , even berni sander in the unit state feed their populist rhetor with the frustrat accumul in the western world .
due to econom and demograph reason , the prosper , the generous social benefit enjoy in the last decad can not continu in the come year .
under the explos pressur of the dual crisi , eurozon - immigr , both caus by hasti decis which onli took into account the integr polit ambit , and not the abil and willing of the peopl and govern of europ to respond to such challeng , turmoil on the contin , intern tension in the eu will increas in intens and can great affect romania 's situat .
it 's hard to exclud possibl scenario .
the main question is whether our polit leader are abl to face such difficult situat .
constantin brancusi , the peasant god .
rockefel : `` how can i help you ? ''
brancusi : `` take the broom and sweep the workshop ! ''
the great sculptor had a big dream : to be somebodi , to get famous , to be known worldwid .
behind his reput there is someth els , someth almost forgotten today . we hear million of success stori , recip for success in life .
that someth has a name .
it 's call `` hard work '' .
what els is there to be written about constantin brancusi ?
what is there to say , realli ?
his face has appear on banknot .
recent , a promin bank in romania has hire an actor to play him in a video ad .
brancusi produc and deliv money near 60 year after he is no longer with us .
in romania , there are hundr of street and avenu that bear his name .
moreov , even the author of this text resid on one of these street .
when it come to take the offspr out for a walk , he hear the follow instruct : `` we re go to the park , to brancusi '' .
the countri is full of his statu .
there are few romanian person whose work are known by so mani peopl , from children to the elder .
brancusi 's penetr capac is huge .
even the communist have fail to extirp him from the memori and cultur of romania .
the internet is full of his quotat , receiv hundr of thousand of like and share .
and then again , what els is there to say , to write about this man ?
seen from the pile of book and articl tri to reconstruct his destini , brancusi 's life seem almost fantast , total improb .
you know , there are peopl who say that if you did n't have the luck to be born in a big citi , in a wealthi famili , your chanc for success in life are virtual nil .
brancusi 's life is the perfect counterexampl .
and perhap this is the key .
perhap the follow text should start here .
with a verdict , howev detest it may be .
forget the stupid success stori , which are deliv daili to you in newspap and on televis .
look care at the face of this man .
do you want to know how he succeed in life , how the whole world heard of him ?
it 's simpl .
he work his whole life to becom someon .
that 's what he did .
constantin brancusi was born on 19 februari 1876 in hobița , a small villag from peștișani , gorj counti , at the foot of the carpathian .
he is the fifth child of maria and radu nicola brancusi .
although he came from a wealthi famili of farmer , brancusi live a modest life , but one that provid his mileston which will guid his artist vision later .
rememb his childhood and the place where he grew up , the artist was go to confess , in a meet with petr tutea , in pari in 1933 : `` back then life was beauti and harmoni '' .
for millennia , peopl were live a happi , patriarch life .
everyth progress quiet from one season to anoth .
and you know whi thing chang ?
the civil of the great citi reach us .
but brancusi 's childhood was far from an idyl one .
one of the moment of his first year of life is high suggest for the combin of puriti and violenc that character the futur sculptor 's year spent in his hometown .
the moment is reproduc in `` brancusi . a biographi '' by alexandru buican .
in 1879 , constantin brancusi was 3 year old .
in the autumn of that year , when plum brandi was made in the alemb , brancusi was watch those who tast the liquid to see if the process was conduct proper , and he seiz a moment of inattent .
he fill his cup hand with brandi and drank in one gulp .
he fell asleep almost instant .
the first peopl notic after a few minut .
his mother panick , then becam hyster , believ her son is dead .
in the even , when his father , radu , return from the vineyard accompani by musician , he saw desper sign in the distanc , the sign of those who were breathless wait for him .
the parti immedi turn into sorrow .
the father was alreadi think of the burial .
yet somehow , someon thought it would be better to call baba brandusa , a healer and servant of the brancusi famili .
brandusa check the child 's breath , then put hors dung collect from the vicin under his nose .
the child sneez loud .
the peopl applaud .
while the boy was allow to sleep off his drunken , the parti continu even louder and with more energi .
the next day , the father and the son meet in the orchard .
radu constantin brancusi sent his son to gather some twig and bring them to him .
the father hold his son upsid down and whip him with the twig , beat him to forev rememb this .
while he feel the sting of the blow , littl brancusi has the revel that the world can also be seen from anoth perspect and that thing around him can seem overturn .
the sun 's posit is differ from the one the boy know , and this make him wonder , as he later admit in his old age , that mayb the star itself bring it contribut to his troubl .
is it possibl that the sun was as troubl as his father becaus of what had happen to him ?
current , the citi doe not work
an mp call on the politician to rememb those who vote for them .
independ deputi viorel blăjuț appeal to psd ( social democrat parti ) and pnl ( liber nation parti ) to ceas their intern disput and reorient their agenda toward the voter .
what we see now on our polit scene is just a great disunion and noth more .
i have not seen ani usl ( social liber union ) project from 2012 to continu .
no highway or region emerg hospit , you onli see how the politician argu over possibl locat base on real estat interest .
we should let polit asid for a time , and we should meet to talk .
current , the citi doe not work .
`` if you re busi with an intern war , you have no time for those who elect you , '' said blăjuț .
he said that the current polit class has disappoint the voter of iasi counti , and the consequ will be a veri low presenc at the upcom local elect , at around 30 % , which is virtual the parti ' loyal elector .
the deputi also believ that the voter will increas focus toward tradit parti , express reserv toward the new polit initi , such as the parti `` for iași '' which will be launch today .
local parti have littl chanc and will onli break the right wing 's elector , and not the one of psd .
such parti reli on civic activ peopl , who are usual from the right wing .
`` the right wing is crumbl further , which is not good for anyon , includ psd '' , said blăjuț .
he said he is not interest in a candidaci for the upcom local elect , deni the rumour of his intent to enter the race for the mayor posit .
i have alreadi state i do not want to run for ani local posit .
i ll think about whether to continu as a deputi for the next offic .
i tri to make an appeal for uniti for iasi dure the discuss on the hallway with the other mps , and i was accus that i want to build an imag .
this is not my intent , but we can not continu in this way .
`` if the peopl vote for us it doe not mean they are stupid enough to vote for us again if they do n't see anyth , '' said blăjuț , who state that the main reason the elector is no longer interest in polit is the hypocrisi of the elect person .
a colleagu from tătărași said that he doe not have enough money and he must go by bus .
let us not be hypocrit .
money is enough .
sometim i 'm asham to take my money from the cashier 's offic .
at the end of the offic i will report everyth i spent besid the cabinet employe ' salari and it mainten .
one month i happen to collect 30,000 lei with the reimburs for transport , accommod and other expens .
`` to say that an mp doe not have enough money is pure hypocrisi '' conclud littl blăjuț .
