some have tri to label him a flip-flopp .
other have dismiss him as a joke .
and some are hold out for an implos .
but no matter how some republican are tri to drag donald trump down from atop the poll , it has n't work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 nation poll have shown donald trump 's lead at doubl digit , and some are start to ask serious what it mean for the real estat mogul 's nomin chanc .
of cours , it 's still earli in the elect cycl .
none of this is to say that trump is like to win the republican nomin .
pundit point out that at this time in 2011 , rick perri 's lead was give way to a rise herman cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomin process .
and there are mani reason he would struggl in a general elect .
but outsid group like jeb bush 's super pac and the econom conserv group club for growth are recogn trump 's stay power and begin to unload their dollar to toppl him .
here are some recent poll number that suggest that the real estat mogul is n't just a pass phase :
trump 's favor rate have turn 180 degre .
right befor donald trump announc his candidaci in mid-jun , a monmouth univers poll show onli two in 10 republican had a posit view of the real estat mogul .
by mid-juli , it was 40 percent .
in earli august , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 republican have a favor view of donald trump .
rough three in 10 say they have a negat view .
and these number hold up in earli state .
a quinnipiac poll in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republican there had a favor view of trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as the nomine .
in a cnn/orc poll last week , 67 percent of republican said they would be either `` enthusiast '' or `` satisfi '' if trump were the nomine .
onli two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nomine .
onli ben carson generat rough the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiast '' vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with onli 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of republican voter say they would be `` dissatisfi '' or `` upset '' if establish favorit jeb bush becom the nomine .
a major of republican do n't see trump 's tempera as a problem .
while donald trump has been wide critic for his bombast and insult , 52 percent of lean republican voter nationwid think that the real estat mogul has the right tempera to be presid , accord to monday 's abc news/washington post poll .
the same number hold in the first-in-the-n caucus state of iowa , where the same 52 percent of republican think he has the person to be command in chief , accord to quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doe n't have the person to serv effect , and almost six in 10 independ say his tempera doe not belong in the white hous , accord to abc/post .
republican voter are get use to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hat , republican voter think trump is for real .
when ask who is most like to win the gop nomin , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , accord to a cnn/orc poll out last week .
that 's a chang from when four in 10 place their money on jeb bush in late juli .
full disclosur : gop voter have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycl , four in 10 republican pick rick perri to win the nomin , vs. onli 28 percent for eventu nomine mitt romney .
still , it show that a plural of gop voter see trump 's campaign as plausibl .
even if republican ralli around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some pundit point out that the splinter field is like contribut to trump 's lead , while anti-trump support is be spread diffus among more than a dozen other candid .
but a monmouth univers poll in earli septemb show that , in a hypothet head-to-head matchup between trump and most other republican candid , trump almost alway garner major support .
he lead car fiorina by 13 point , marco rubio by 14 point , walker by 15 point , jeb bush by 19 point , and , final , rand paul , john kasich and chris christi by 33 point each .
he 's in a dead heat with ted cruz .
the onli candid who beat him ?
ben carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 point in a hypothet head-to-head .
a bare major of donald trump 's support say they ve made up their mind .
a new cbs/nyt poll out on tuesday show that just more than half of voter who support trump say they have lock in their vote .
obvious , a lot can happen to chang that , and no one can realli say they would never chang their mind .
46 percent said they are leav the door open to switch candid .
still , trump 's strongest competit at the moment is from fellow outsid neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who say they have made up their mind are twice as like to go for trump .
six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr .
even sinc donald trump call immigr from mexico `` rapist '' in his campaign announc speech two month ago , immigr has been front and center in the 2016 convers .
some are worri that trump 's bombast will drive crucial hispan voter away from the republican parti and damag rebrand effort .
but accord to monday 's new abc/post poll , six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr issu .
so as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , it seem donald trump will remain too .
frustrat with govern is climb to new high .
donald trump and ben carson now account for rough half of the support from republican voter , larg due to their outsid status .
six in 10 republican in monday 's new abc/post poll say they want a polit outsid over someon with govern experi .
and they are angri at washington , too .
a des moin register/bloomberg poll in iowa from two week ago show that three in four iowa republican are frustrat with republican in congress , with 54 percent `` unsatisfi '' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . ''

here 's what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will climb and the economi will slip into a recess .
this we know .
what we do n't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economi specif , histori offer littl guid about time .
a recess has come as quick as 11 month after the first rate hike and as long as 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , a determin in how the economi and financi asset respond .
that 's whi offici at the u.s. central bank have stress so vigor that investor should not be focus on when it start rais rate but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are , inde , multipl variabl at play .
in the end , howev , market particip may find that all the rate-hik fuss may have been overdon .
`` the first hike from the fed sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as signal the end of the era of cheap money , ' `` julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom , said in a note to client .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rate to more normal but still low level to be the seismic shock that mani seem to fear .
that 's not to say there wo n't be effect , howev .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi could react , base on histor trend :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip of rate hike can make thing volatil for a while .
onc the hike hit , though , the impact is not as dramat .
`` it doe seem there is a trend for equiti return to stall 12-24 month after the first hike , which again perhap reflect the lag in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi of what happen after the fed hike .
more specif , the market over the past 35 year or so is most often up sharpli - about 14 percent - head into the rate hike , fair flat in the 250 day after ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal onc 500 day have pass , with averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi bob doll , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , post on barron 's .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to get more pronounc later in the rate-hik cycl and return begin to diminish .
recess are a fact of econom life , but rate hike often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is face some condit that did not exist befor and could hasten a recess .
most notabl , gross domest product will be near it lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , in the 118 rate hike sinc 1950 , onli twice has nomin year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter track at just 1.5 percent , accord to the atlanta fed .
hike rate into such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and set up the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip have been brace for a fed hike all year , with all eye turn toward this week 's feder open market committe meet , which end thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv a hike at this meet , futur trade indic just a 25 percent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all hike cycl to date have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp eclips prerecess peak veri quick post the recoveri commenc , '' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest the fed has wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record had been 35 month , and this is 74 month and count .
fix incom also has been volatil as the market anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equiti experi .
the princip differ is that the impact happen faster in bond than stock when the fed chang cours in polici .
for bond , it doe seem yield chang direct immedi as the first hike/cut in the cycl arriv .
at the end of the hike cycl bond yield fall immedi , '' deutsch said .
charl schwab strategist believ the hike in rate will caus yield between longer- and shorter-d bond to move closer togeth , flatten the curv .
high-yield bond often perform better in such a climat , though `` we are still cautious about stretch for yield , '' kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab , said in an analysi .
interest , jone think market alreadi have adapt to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread have widen and volatil has increas - all characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad speak , compani that do the major of their busi in the u.s. will win as interest rate rise and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt will fare wors , as a rise dollar make their product more expens in the global market space and their debt more expens the financ .
`` histori show that qualiti ' stock tend to outperform dure the three month follow an initi rate hike , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report for client .
firm with strong balanc sheet outpac weak balanc sheet compani follow each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hike , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit as well as low volatil stock also outperform their lower qualiti counterpart , by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) , respect .
debt will becom a big issu .
compani with a high percentag of float rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outsid pure stock play , consum stand to benefit as well through the rise dollar .
saver could see gain as well through higher yield at the , though expert differ on how quick that will take hold .

unlik the major of other oil , it can be use in the prepar of hot dish and has a number of effect that are benefici to one 's health .
it often occur in gall-bladd diet .
sesam oil contain essenti fatti acid that help prevent gallston .
90 % of gallston are caus by inflamm of the gall bladder , a problem that affect women three time more than it doe men .
gall-bladd issu general affect peopl who are overweight , do n't take part in sport and consum a lot of anim fat .
sesam oil is also a veri good compon of a liver diet , which is veri similar to a gall bladder one .
to enjoy the full benefit of consum sesam oil , be care about which exot foodstuff you buy .
product from asia often use excess roast seed , which usual have a stronger tast .

the most popular oil in the czech republ is sunflow oil .
a studi conduct by jarmila hamerská ( masarykova univerzita , brno ) found that 43 % of respond prefer sunflow oil when cook .
sunflow is not , howev , suitabl for cook , as it start to overheat at 180 °c .
it 's better for e.g . season salad and as part of control diet , where it help prevent cardiovascular diseas ,

lifespan can be extend through fridg storag .
old oil can main be recognis from it bitter tast .
on the other hand , cloudi at the bottom is not a defect ;
it 's a sign that the product has not been chemic refin .
hemp oil contain the highest quantiti of healthi acid .
their extrem high omega-3 and omega-6 unsatur fatti acid content mean that seed of proper cultiv hemp are one of the so-cal superfood
and hemp oil is therefor regard as the healthiest veget oil .
the human bodi can not produc these essenti fatti acid by itself and must be absorb from food .

howev , by 1991 it was n't produc ani .
the compani had to quick find new custom .
back then it start work with european aviat produc airbus .
it won a tender for the suppli of emerg door for the a321 model .
approach to boe were not so success .
`` at the time we were too small a firm that did n't have enough money for invest or to be abl to guarante boe the long-term stabil of suppli , '' rememb dubský .
the door to the american produc would have stay close had letov not caught the attent pf the french latecoer group at the intern air transport associ confer in pragu in 1999 .
i was talk about our cooper with airbus .
the next day we start negoti with the french , say dubský .
a year later , latecoer bought the czech compani , and with a major compani came new order .
as as earli as 2000 the compani start produc door part for the a320 .
three year later , they also start produc door for the upper deck of the a380 .
in 2006 the compani built a new product hall for the process of composit for order for the boe dreamlin .
without latecoer we would n't have won those big order ourselv .
mayb we 'd have been make part or small compon .
our partner want a twenty- to thirty-year guarante for good suppli , explain dubský .
last year the czech latecoer achiev turnov of over 2.9 billion crown and an after-tax profit of 147 million crown .
have an exclus status among supplier to aviat manufactur come at a price .
sinc 2000 , latecoer has invest 1.5 billion crown in the pragu compani .
the compani must have qualiti certif , certif for 1270 special product process and qualif certif for key employe .
without these , the compani would not be abl to manufactur aeroplan door .
accord to dubský , gain certif that product process meet client ' requir and maintain them through repeat inspect cost million of crown .
product process chang everi year ,
becom everi more precis and stringent .
we have to give employe addit train , upgrad equip and have the entir process re-certifi , add dubský .
the compani is current complet prepar for a metal-pl process use zinc and nickel , rather than cadmium , which is harm to human health .
although they receiv the assign from the manufactur , they then had to adapt their technolog to the equip and chemic use in pragu .
the boe peopl come and verifi the concept of the entir product line .
then we produc their good .
they also inspect our laboratori .
they test one set of sampl themselv in their own laboratori then compar the result with our , say dubský , describ the inspect process use by their client .
the pragu compani 's reward for this are exclus , long-term contract .
the product of embraer plane today stand and fall with the pragu plant ,
which produc half of it total volum of door .
replac the czech branch of latecoer would be veri complic , if not imposs , for the brazilian or european produc .
howev , this doe not mean that they can name their price for door .
an integr part of the contract is the price curv .
this state how much door will cost per ten , fifti and one hundr piec produc .
the piec price fall to a certain limit valu .
we must fit into this price equat .
if not , we ll be lose money , say dubský .
half of the hall where the electr box for the airbus a400 m militari plane are be complet is so far empti .
it is , howev , a symbol of the futur .
behind the partit they are build a new semi-robot product line for the rivet and assembl of door for the new a320 neo model .
this will lead to faster , more precis rivet .
`` this is a grow trend in aviat rivet , '' add dubský .
the futur product has it sale secur .
airbus has announc that airlin have so far order 3,270 of the the a320 model .
onli a few metr away they are build a product line for the complet assembl of door for the upper deck of the a380 .
this was a strateg decis of our parent compani .
the goal is to shorten the product time and lower cost .
the full assembl process could start within two year , say dubský .
befor this , howev , the compani must undergo qualificatori test for e.g . the assembl of some electr and electron equip for door intend for the largest airbus .
the compani is reli on the further develop of product from composit materi .
apart from boe , it should also particip in the new airbus a350 programm , which will compet with the american dreamlin .
`` it 's a massiv boost to the compani when it can produc both metal and composit materi , '' say dubský proud .
howev , latecoer is reach the limit of it product capac in the czech republ .
there is no more space in the letov complex where it is base .
befor it was taken over by it french parent compani , it had 180 employe .
now it has 800 employe , and might have a hundr more within three year .
as long as airbus and boe will compet over how mani hundr of new aeroplan are order by airlin everi year , latecoer wo n't have to worri about work .
despit have order for sever year to come , latecoer 's parent compani was face bankruptci .
the french group did n't have enough money to cover it septemb loan payment .
in the end , latecoer was abl to come to an agreement with it main creditor ,
who exchang part of their loan for share at the end of august .
creditor gain a share of 37.4 percent in the compani through a 57.4 million eur increas in capit .
compani debt was reduc by two third , equal to 180 million eur .
the second part of the financi remedi came at the begin of septemb ,
when the compani distribut new share to the valu of 222.9 million eur among exist sharehold .
the compani thus increas it base capit by a total 280 million eur .
the entir group benefit from the grow product of airbus and boe , who between them have a 85 percent market share .
it anticip an averag annual rise of four percent in order up to 2017 .
it order book contain order worth 2.6 billion eur , correspond to four year ' worth of product .
the french media has said that latecoer can final breath easi after be on a drip-fe for year .
the czech plant in letňani is a major one for the group ,
contribut 16 percent of it incom .
it is the group 's largest branch abroad by number of employe .
mps support greater state share in coal fee
a chang in fee for the mine of miner is to bring 427 million crown more into state coffer than was the case in 2013 .

the amount of mine fee will no longer be determin by law , but stipul by the govern through decre .
payment will be calcul as the product of the quantiti of miner mine and rate for individu type of miner .
accord to the govern , the reason for the chang is , among other , the option of react flexibl to the current econom situat .
howev , mp marek benda ( od ) warn that the set of fee by govern decre may not be in accord with the constitut .
minist mládek respond say that this would not be a tax , as in this case the govern is make miner - which are state properti - subject to a fee .
fee are receiv by the municip whose territori is affect by mine .
in the case of deep coal mine , three-quart of the money is receiv by municip and one quarter by the state .
the same proport shall appli to the extract of radioact rock .
part of the money collect by the state from fee shall be tie to a singl purpos .

the propos was today criticis by opposit mps , who chiefli claim that it would harm both municip and region govern .
for exampl , michal kučera ( top 09 a starostové ) warn that mine compani would no longer want to sponsor municip as befor , as they would have to pay higher fee direct into state coffer .

communist mp hana aulická also warn of increas unemploy in the most area .
kádner and aulická unsuccess propos the reject of the amend , and kučera want to return it to the govern for revis .
the explanatori report state that , accord to extract compani , increas in fee would not be transmit to coal price as more than 90 percent of these are agre on a long-term basi .
the chief consum , power station , would not , therefor , feel an increas in price .
`` on the other hand , though , this fact increas the risk that extract organis will compens for increas payment with effort to reduc their oper cost , which would primarili mean a reduct in the number of employe , '' admit the govern .
howev , it also state that a fee increas would be bearabl in term of employ .

he emphasis that , were coal to be mine beyond the limit , it would have an impact on yield for both the state and municip .
urban doe not agre with mládek on the fact that the decis on the break of the limit at the československé armádi mine should onli be taken after 2020 .
he said that limit at the československé armádi mine should be broken due to social reason , the nation economi and the czech energi sector .

sure david cameron know the lorax better than this ?
it 's one thing ani parent soon learn : when your child love a book , it wo n't be long befor you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seem , you are david cameron .
ask by a provid of holiday childcar scheme to name his favourit kid ' book , the prime minist opt for the lorax , the 1971 environment fabl by dr seuss .
it was a difficult choic , cameron write in a messag publish on the websit of the supercamp compani , continu : `` funni , move , creativ and with a power messag , it 's one i enjoy read to my children becaus there alway seem to be an imag or a messag that we have previous miss . ''
all veri well , except that the subsequ paragraph in which cameron suppos describ the plot of the book instead give a précis of the 2012 film version , which ad new charact and detail to pad out the fair brief origin text .
`` set in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where all natur has gone and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey , by fulfil her wish to see a real tree , '' it read , chronicl a love interest unknown to dr seuss , real name theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
if that was n't suspici enough , cameron 's submit text read in part like a plot summari of the lorax film provid on the internet movi databas websit , which begin : `` in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where everyth is artifici and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey . ''
given he is an avow hands-on parent , it seem unlik cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnam boy hear how the local environ was devast by the avarici , tree-chop , thneed-knit once-l , despit the protest of the eponym lorax , a squat , moustachio creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like , such a relat lowli pr task would have been outsourc to an aid , seem one who has never read the lorax 20 time in a row to a child .
a down street spokeswoman said the text was believ to have come from cameron 's constitu offic .
supercamp confirm that the text was provid from cameron 's staff , but had no further immedi comment .
adam lyth was clear at risk of england omiss but it 's still tough
take on pakistan in the unit arab emir is a tough assign but after see the squad england have select for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat suffer last time doe not look on the card for me .
i would n't rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago but there are good player of spin in that bat lineup and the collect mindset is strong ; they will not carri scar from 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali is develop as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop from england test squad and replac by alex hale
the decis to omit adam lyth is obvious a tough one for me to analys as his head coach at yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are judg on output .
there were no question mark over joe root , for exampl , lead up to the announc becaus - and i have said this befor - player are their own best selector .
a coupl of half-centuri and lyth might have seen his run extend but he was in control of his own destini .
hope if he punch out more run for yorkshir anoth opportun will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud even when he was not perform as well as he can and that doe not surpris me ; he is a team man abov all els .
the question of how long a test batsman get to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven cap - like sam robson befor him - while nick compton got nine .
onli compton got the chanc home and away .
the onli gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wast opportun is in the past now .
alex hale come in and he is a batsman i rate high .
he is an x-factor cricket , which we at yorkshir saw earli this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch that was do a bit .
he must at least be afford the same opportun as those befor him but this will of cours depend on the make-up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen open the bat alongsid cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keep four quick , has been float and it is not someth i am against .
i do n't see whi a strokemak can not bat there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he is one hell of a cricket .
moeen may not have done the job for his counti , worcestershir , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much differ .
my old team-mat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop befor step up to open in 2001 .
he peel off three centuri immedi and did not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limit deal with him , he has struck me as veri impress young man .
peopl may look at his raw stat - averag 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a heap of spinner put their hand up and selector have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a coupl of shrewd addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the game 's loveliest bloke , who will bring a wealth of experi have done it in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood come in for the white-bal leg of the tour and will bring both energi and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i alway felt he was born to be involv in intern cricket , be it play or coach , and like mahela has nous that can be tap .
sometim new voic in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with what has been said befor , can freshen up a side .
colli 's durham team-mat ben stoke is rest for the one-day , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issu with this .
while not everyon will agre , the coach and selector do not set the schedul .
and you have to rememb , like player , their job are depend on result .
such decis are never taken light .
brexit camp might win the day if economi is in doldrum by 2017
david cameron 's half-bak renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu get deeper into troubl with everi day that pass , even without the elect of genial jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cut up rough over europ on tuesday .
foreign have their corbyn and nigel farag too .
a european diplomat chum explain the other day that , sunk in assort crise as the eu is - not all of their own make - some member state are fed up with britain 's self-absorb agenda of divis concess and disrupt treati chang which they most do n't want .
in brighton for it annual bean , the tuc decid it did n't want them either if they erod social protect .
we could even call it dave and georg 's selfi agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summit or bilater session in foreign capit , take a photo of themselv in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grande , then come home and say they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european pal , who want an outward-look britain insid the eu tent - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that more short-sight minist and offici in some capit have got to the point where they do n't care whether we stay or leav .
angela merkel , germani 's cautious level-head chancellor , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year and want to leav offic befor it goe bad for her , as it did for overstay thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
franc 's françoi holland is face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
he is a fade forc too .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern of the right , spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them break a leg to help the selfi brit , whose energi might be better spent prevent scotland leav the uk - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some such minist may even be plan to make deliber unhelp remark , snp-style , dure the uk 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggest .
`` the renegoti was a fix '' and `` britain got noth of valu out of the renegoti . ''
the european know to their cost how predatori fleet street can be and how eu-scept the oligarch press baron are , as they were not dure the toni benn-inspir 1975 referendum which endors our 1973 entri by a ratio of 2:1 .
they may dim rememb bori johnson , the arch euro-opportunist , make his name as an `` eu straight banana '' brussel correspond in the earli 90s .
for all his foolish ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
they includ the medley of tax-shi rascal , phone-hack foreign and pseudo non-dom who own most of our great newspap .
actual toni blair thought much the same about them , but realis that when you re in a cage with a randi gorilla you have to pass the banana to distract it from have you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairit than blair in oppos cameron 's referendum wheez , sinc blair had conced the principl over the eu 's abort constitut , sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgav him that either .
but nice jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back at westminst on monday - i told him he no longer has time to wast on me - seem to be in danger of re-adopt neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of the 80s , a mistak then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coher strategi to engag with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacat on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit on europ is what i will kind call evolv .
he say he 'd like us to stay in a reform eu .
well , most peopl outsid ukip 's woad-wear tendenc and the wilder shore of tori littl englander can probabl say yes to that .
it 's what hilari `` a benn , but not a bennit '' benn said on radio and tv this week as the boy scout in him struggl not to admit that corbyn 's appoint of abras john mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it remind me of the 70s , when his old dad struggl on tv to be disloy to labour cabinet colleagu without go too far and lose his cabinet job .
hilari 's struggl was more attract .
but fight to stay in `` in all circumst '' - benn 's phrase - was not what mcdonnel was say , nor what jc told peer and mps at their privat meet on monday night , by all account .
whatev the bottom-up , touchy-fe imag corbyn want to convey - rememb , he even touch me - messag disciplin remain import in the age of 24/7 tv and especi in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it 's fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europ , allow him to take labour 's support for grant in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel has said .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnel and corbyn 's basic equivoc about eu membership - consist with their bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among leftw dissid for whom the narciss of small differ is a central tenet of doctrin squabbl .
as with his equivoc over nato - tom watson is adam that jc wo n't campaign to quit - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to make sens of it all for their master at home .
whi should pari or berlin wast polit capit - they have suspici voter too - on concess to britain when it may all be pointless ?
the us is alreadi pretti disappoint with the brit '' feebl militari perform in iraq , libya and syria , even with a cost-cut tori govern in power , as i was remind at the launch of someth call the british influenc secur forum on monday .

the research paper produc by the group `` tell conced '' there is a lack of `` hard evid for the harm of most product on most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or limit are discuss in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe 's claim that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett are act as a rout into smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had been respond to befor .
he said : `` e-cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one in two lifelong smoker die from their addict .
all of the evid suggest that the health risk pose by e-cigarett are small by comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what it doe not show , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die of a smoking-rel ill and smoke cost the nhs £2bn a year .
by spell out clear the current evid - that while e-cigarett are not risk-fre , they carri onli a fraction of the harm caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation remit .
bbc should give up eastend , say former channel 4 chief
the former channel 4 chairman luke johnson has said the bbc should stop broadcast programm such as eastend and the voic , say it commerci rival would `` give their right arm '' for hit show such as the albert squar soap .
johnson said the licenc fee should onli be use to make the sort of programm that are not made by other uk broadcast .
he criticis the bbc for put public servic programm like to be watch by a smaller audienc in tough slot against it rival '' biggest rate show , and on channel such as bbc4 .
after the bbc 's director general , toni hall , said the corpor want to do more in partnership with other organis , johnson said he had tri for six year in his time at channel 4 to do a tie-up with the bbc without success .
`` i do struggl with the idea that the bbc commiss and broadcast programm that would clear be shown by unsubsidis rival , '' johnson told the hous of lord communic committe , as part of it inquiri into the futur of the bbc .
if you keep the licenc fee , which i 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduc it output at least to programm that other are n't make and commiss .
they broadcast the voic in a prime slot becaus they want to gain as broad a support as possibl for it futur .
the idea that no one els would show that is a joke , it 's ludicr , it 's obvious nonsens .
johnson said : `` i do n't see whi a regress tax should fund programm that could be fund without subsidi .
the voic is one , eastend is anoth , admit made in-hous .
frank other channel would give their right arm for it .
i struggl to see how it 's public servic broadcast .
i do n't think that would diminish the bbc at all .
johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the bbc was guilti of chase rate `` becaus of the ambit of peopl who work there , and becaus they believ that is the best way to secur long-term support . ''
his comment about the bbc 's most popular show echo those of former sky execut toni ball , who use his mactaggart lectur in edinburgh in 2003 to propos that the bbc sell off show such as eastend .
johnson said the bbc 's more nich public servic programm `` go on to bbc4 where quit often you ca n't measur the audienc but they fulfil their remit and they can argu when they go on their sanctimoni mission about justifi £4bn in licenc fee incom , `` well of cours , we do all these obscur programm that no one watch . ''
they put them on a slot where no one was ever go to watch them .
on the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i challeng you to find a more regress system in term of who get the best valu from it .
of cours you all think , we all think , £150 a year is great valu , but for peopl for whom £150 is a lot of money i wonder if they do becaus they do n't consum a lot of the bbc .
former sky and channel 5 execut david elstein , who also gave evid to the committe on tuesday , said the bbc should revis it reithian mission to `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he said littl of the bbc 's output was now formal classifi as educ - he said it was 1 % of it tv output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public servic broadcast in australia and canada and chang it to `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
on the issu of partnership , elstein said the bbc should do more in area such as the prom , of which he said onli a hand were shown on tv , and enter into allianc with commerci broadcast to make them all avail to watch onlin .
sonogenet ' allow brain cell to be control by sound wave
the video show how the nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls .
scientist have bred worm with genet modifi nervous system that can be control by burst of sound wave .
the tini nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls that are too high-pitch for human to hear .
the puls work by switch on motor neuron cell that are genet modifi to carri membran channel that respond to ultrason wave .
relat : research read and write brain activ with light
research said the worm demonstr the power of a new procedur , dub sonogenet , in which ultrasound can be use to activ a rang of brain , heart and muscl cell from outsid the bodi .
sreekanth chalasani , a research at the salk institut in la jolla , california , told the guardian that the procedur could one day replac deep-brain stimul , an invas procedur that deliv electr puls into peopl 's brain to treat symptom of parkinson 's diseas .
nematod worm do not usual react to ultrasound , but chalasani found that they did when they were surround by a fluid contain microscop bubbl .
the bubbl , he found , amplifi the ultrason wave which then pass insid the worm .
the amplifi ultrasound wave act on structur call trp-4 ion channel , found in the membran of some of the worm '' cell .
the sound wave make these ion channel open up and activ the cell they are attach to , accord to a report in natur communic .
to make ultrasound-control nematod , chalasani genet modifi the worm so that some of their motor neuron carri trp-4 ion channel .
when he appli ultrasound to the modifi creatur , the sound wave were amplifi by the microbubbl and transmit into the worm , where they switch on the modifi motor neuron .
the procedur has some similar with optogenet , a groundbreak tool that allow scientist to switch neuron on and off with puls of light .
but chalasani said that sonogenet could have some advantag over that techniqu .
unlik light , which has to be sent down an optic fibr to the desir locat insid the brain , low frequenc ultrasound wave can pass through tissu unhind , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
`` we believ that , use gene therapi and a therapeut virus , it may be possibl to make target human neuron temporarili suscept to the ultrasound signal in a clinic set for certain neurolog treatment , '' said chalasani .
other applic could focus on muscl cell and insulin-produc cell , he ad .

eight golden rule for live in student hall
it 's been 11 year sinc i move into student hall as an oblivi 19-year-old , still believ in beret and moral relativ , but it 's onli now i recal the strain smile of those i annoy - and the numer , lengthi complaint about other .
most of what i learn can be distil into eight simpl rule .
move into hall can rang from mild nerve-rack to total terrifi .
it 's tempt to babbl : tell peopl where you re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on corbyn and whi you `` honest neither love nor hate marmit becaus serious guy it 's just yeast extract hahaha i ll be in my room . ''
take a breath .
and help other take one too - ask question and show interest .
it steer the convers and help you to scout out the peopl you like versus those you would n't talk to even if your eyelash were on fire and they were dispens extinguish .
give peopl space .
peopl 's room often morph into drink recept , movie-night venu and communal hangout spot , but they re also where peopl get dress and adjust their underwear .
relat : do n't even think about start univers in a relationship
introvert get a raw deal at univers .
your room should be a retreat , yet mani hall form an inter-room-strol cultur that 's friend , social and conduc to lifelong friendship .
that can be hell for someon who 's tri to recharg .
noth in the cultur allow you to say , `` i like you and i want our friendship to continu , but i need you to go away so i can get back the energi i ve expend on interact with you . ''
tri to sens when a fellow student is exhaust from socialis - and mayb text instead of knock .
speak of knock : do it .
one guy in my student hall had a polici that if a door was n't lock he was invit in .
he saw some thing .
make friend through bake .
sinc you re start uni at the height of bake-off mania , knock on peopl 's door to introduc yourself with a plate of browni seem margin less weird , less 1950s `` welcom to the neighbourhood , i bake you someth , now smile as i ask you person question . ''
offer homemad treat is a great way to make friend .
your housem will feel oblig to chat , and may end up associ your face with a tasti surpris .
obvious this is subject to you be a decent baker .
poorly-fus lump of flour , sugar and fat are more like to make peopl pretend to be asleep when you knock .
steal food is a common crime in student hall .
obvious nick someon chicken is theft , but is take a drop of milk for your tea steal ?
doubl check with the milk owner .
chanc are they ll tell you to help yourself even if they re seeth insid .
if someon steal your stuff , it 's annoy and you have my sympathi - but tri to deal with it more matur than my hallmat , who taint her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it .
she 's in jail now .
you should n't make nois that keep peopl from sleep or studi .
this is n't just to be a decent human , but becaus you are the proverbi peopl in glass hous .
a girl on my corridor ask her neighbour if they would n't mind turn down the drum and bass becaus it was 3am and she had an exam in the morn .
they respond by turn it up .
when they final shut up at 5am , she kind let them sleep for two hour befor blast her own music , lock her door as she left for her three-hour exam .
would n't it be romant if your futur spous happen to move into the same hall as you ?
convers , would n't it be knuckle-bit awkward if you mistook a hallmat for your futur spous , hook up , broke up and had to see them everi day and possibl watch them get custodi of all your mutual friend ?
of cours , the heart want what it want - but if a hot hallmat is definit not your futur spous , tri to at least talk some sens into your groin .
in the exhilar moment you realis someon 's left their key insid their unlock room , the line between prank and bulli is finer than it seem .
a good prank is funni , but take moment to revers .
teach a valuabl and amus lesson about secur by hide someth - but never trash someon 's room with toothpast and shampoo .
lock their door and put their key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do n't blu-tack their possess to the ceil more than twice .
eva look forward to have twin , despit uncertain prospect for the futur .
eva experienc hardship even while she was pregnant with vítek , who is now seven year old .
vítek 's father had left her , leav her to prepar for the babi on her own .
i came to term with the situat relat quick - i was realli look forward to the babi and look for the posit .
i tri not to bother myself with uncertainti and the fact that i 'd be bring the babi up on my own .
and i definit had the hope that we would n't be on our own for long , say eva , rememb her first pregnanc .
even back then , on the internet she met vašek , who was older than her and who she start to talk about her favourit film with .
vašek even took eva and vítek home from the matern hospit , but was n't in too much of a rush to assum the role of stepfath .

in the end , even the prospect of respons for someon els 's child did n't spoil vašek 's affect for eva .
they final becam a coupl around vítek 's second birthday , and vítek now see vašek as his father , and call him this , too .
even though vašek alreadi has two adult daughter , he himself say that he is enjoy fatherhood at sixti , and can also devot more time to children .
sinc then , vítek has been join by two-year old leontýna , and even twin .
`` vašek has fit right in with our famili , mayb becaus my mother has never interf in my relationship much , '' smile eva .
not much space ?
at least we re close to one anoth .
twin ema and ela were born by caesarean section after eva was diagnos with cholestasi in the close stage of her pregnanc .
cholestasi is a disord in the product and activ of bile acid , which then occur in excess amount in the blood of the pregnant woman and manifest itself in itchi .
the ill is danger to the unborn foetus , which is at risk of prematur birth and death . it usual disappear of it own accord in the mother follow birth .
luckili for eva and vašek , ema and ela were born healthi , even though she was onli in her 36th week .
littl ema was place in an incub on an intermediari ward where vašek 's niec work , who was abl to take care of her and see that she was accommod .

eva is convinc that the children see the comfort of famili life and the pleasant atmospher , and not the size or shabbi of the hous .
for now we re cope quit well , better than we 'd expect .
while it 's harder to hide untidi in such a small space and we sometim step over the roll babi , at least we re all close to one anoth , laugh eva , who can see the posit side of ani situat .
as vašek 's work as a light technician in film doe n't guarante a regular incom ,
he sometim goe on the street of pragu as a taxi driver .
even at sixti , he himself say that he is physic manag to support the famili and children - but how long will this be the case ?
`` i realis that , due to the age gap , one day it ll be me who has to support the famili , '' admit eva honest when ask about the futur .
she would like to return to paid work , but is more attract by the possibl of start her own busi .
i ve got four children , i 'm not exact hot properti for employ .
if the worst come to the worst , we can share the taxi , joke the good-natur blond .
appl hit by the yo-yo effect .
it 's all becaus of the display .
a more power processor , higher-resolut camera , stronger case and display screen that can discern differ touch strength are the advantag offer by the recent launch ninth-gener iphon .
the last two list have a negat impact on the dimens and weight of 6s and 6s plus iphon .
up until now the trend with appl has been for everi generat of iphon to be lighter than the one befor it .
the onli except to this were the third and fourth generat , whose weight was slight more than that of preced iphon .
howev , the two-gramm differ from previous model was truli neglig .
this is far from true for new iphon .
compar to last year 's 6 and 6 plus iphon , the weight of the smaller model rose by 14 gramm and the larger by a whole 20 gramm .
on the one hand it 's no wonder - last year 's affair with phone bend in pocket caus appl some consider problem .
the new model ' case is made of tougher 7000 aluminium alloy , which also manifest itself in the weight .
howev , the display have a much greater impact .
in these new model appl has use 3d touch technolog , which help display distinguish between the strength of touch .
this meant that display had to be fit with an extra layer of capac sensor .
the weight of the screen of new iphon thus more than doubl against preced generat .
in the smaller iphon it rose from 12 to 29 gramm , and in the larger one from 19 to 40 gramm .
in the iphon 6s the display is the heaviest compon use .
the full weight of this new model , a mere 143 gramm , is then reach through the stiffen case , which affect all other compon .
in the larger model , the largest compon use is the batteri , whose weight has not , howev , increas against it predecessor .
here , too , the greatest growth has been in the display .
the weight of the 5.5 '' iphon 6s is thus 192 gramm .
the practic of the new display technolog will becom appar onli through use .
user will be abl to tri it our for the first time on friday 25 septemb , when sale of the iphon 6s and 6s plus will begin in select countri .
have flake been the breakfast of champion for ten of thousand of year ?
archaeologist in grotta paglicci , itali have made a discoveri that open up interest possibl .
they have discov trace of settlement of modern human from various period , includ wall-paint , remain of tool and so on .
howev , at level 23a , which accord to the tool found date back 30 thousand year , research have found someth that is strong reminisc of the remain of a breakfast buffet .
at the site they found trace of oat grain that appar went through a product process similar to the oat flake that are so popular today .
in this process , grain are first soak , then dri , shell , blanch and flatten .
grain have been found in paglicci cave that were evid heat up or blanch , then ground between two millston - this is at least indic by trace of use found on two stone in the cave .
while research were not abl to prove in their articl for pnas magazin that the complet flake product process took place in the cave , the resembl is quit strike .
we also do not have ani evid of how the peopl ate the flake , although the possibl that it would have been with some liquid and quit possibl also serv warm , is entir logic .
at the same time it is high interest evid of how intens peopl use cereal , even long befor the rise of agricultur .
thus if the oat flake interpret is correct , the oldest flake preced agricultur by approxim twenti thousand year .
new stop announc with the brno public transport comapni
so onc again i listen to the announc of the name of stop in the trolleybus : hnusáčkova , přízrak , frázova , spratecká .
for sure , the trolleybus was a bit noisier , so the male voic make the announc was somewhat less easi to understand than befor , when the stop were announc by a femal voic .
the femal voic is higher-pitch , so in the deeper nois of public transport it 's easier to pick out than the deeper male voic .
while the public transport compani argu that the voic was chosen by passeng themselv - i do n't know which one , they did n't ask me - they must have chosen it from studio record made in complet silenc , which obvious sound complet differ than against the racket of a bus engin .
i ve live in brno for quit a few decad now , so i know the correct name of all those stop off by heart and obvious i do n't need these announc , but peopl from other place who do n't know their way around brno , and at whom these announc are main aim , might be confus , and if they go to the final stop by mistak , they can claim that the stop they were meant to get off at was n't announc .
mayb they should run the select process for an announc again , this time with the addit of transport nois and the racket of a motor , in which the mutter of the bus loudspeak almost get lost .
then i would n't have to listen to stop call vodní heršpic , šmírova , or ponorná in the screech tram that i got onto at komárov .
in my old age i do n't think that my hear got that much wors in the singl day when they chang the announc .
befor that day i understood the announc quit well .
good morn , comrad superintend
note by a railway worker
few peopl today know what the so-cal complex check were dure the rule of the biggest , smartest polit parti .
let me reminisc .
the bus was delay .
i enter the dispatch 's offic at the moment the radio announc that it was seven o'clock .
`` you re lucki you did n't bump into the comrad superintend , he got here a minut befor you and he did n't look like he was in a great mood , '' note the dispatch while i was write my name in the visitor ' book .
thank , i ll be care .
write that i ve go through the district to review minor mechan devic .
ca n't do it - the check are on today .
we re all crap ourselv becaus of it , it 's terribl .
what 's it all about ?
`` you ll see , '' said the dispatch , make a face .
you will next time , too .
i ran out to the corridor .
at that moment the door to the superintend 's offic open and the superintend appear .
buttoned-up , with a stoni face and perfect fit uniform .
`` good morn , comrad superintend , '' i greet him respect , quick do up the two button of my uniform jacket .
`` good morn , '' he repli and i quick ran up to the first floor , without notic the cold , forebod tone that the older man had repli in .
`` you re just play , '' i was welcom by engin eva , an elder ladi for whom i had a lot of respect .
appar she 'd even been the superintend until she was remov by the comrad .
we ve got check on and you onli just make it .
how mani time had i ask what these complex check were , but no-on want to talk about it .
appar they onli happen onc everi three year , everyon has to attend them , and they re quit unpleas .
at least for some .
well , they said i 'd see .
i pull a file with period announc out of a drawer . at that moment the phone rang .
`` holcman here , come to my offic immedi , '' said the superintend 's voic .
what 's his problem ?
we met each other now and noth ... '' i mumbl , but no-on answer , all of them lost in their thought .
`` hello , comrad superintend , here on your order , '' i report , bare insid the superintend 's offic .
the superintend was sit behind his desk , look over some paperwork .
`` comrad mechan , '' he announc after a moment , without rais his head and still care scan the paperwork , `` your behaviour doe not pleas me at all . ''
he threw the paperwork down on the tabl , lean on the armrest of his chair and look at me with a fix , unpleas , spite , pierc look .
i becam disconcert .
what 's up ?
onli yesterday his deputi was prais me , say that i 'd settl in veri well in my few month in the job and that he was happi with me to the highest possibl degre ,
and that the superintend had done veri well when he pull me out of the track brigad .
and now this ?
you must realis that you are a railway track technician and you must behav accord .
the type of greet that you use this morn was simpli unaccept .
i stammer that i 'd use this greet sinc childhood , that that was how i 'd been brought up and that i did n't see anyth wrong with it .
it was like a red rag to a bull for the superintend .
`` you work on a socialist railway and the onli accept greet is čest práci ' ( honour to work ' ) , '' snap the superintend .
and furthermor , you re still mix up greet to your superior .
one minut you say mr ' and the next it 's comrad ' .
to you , i 'm not mr superintend , but comrad superintend .
deputi are comrad deputi , head track mainten supervisor are to be address as comrad track mainten supervisor !
now kind rememb that !
i 'm sorri , mr ... comrad superintend , but ... but i greet you with a normal , everyday greet .
there 's noth bad about that , after all ... and that honour to work , or comrad ... you know ... i 'm not in the parti ...
`` that is n't one of your virtu , that you are n't in the parti , '' declar the superintend cold , have calm down slight in the meantim .
you ll hear more about that later .
in ani case , bear in mind that you have n't got that chair upstair reserv until you retir .
that was n't good .
when the superintend told someon that someth was n't one of their virtu , the prospect were n't good for whoever was on the receiv end .
for a moment he look at me with a cold , pierc look and i search for word to answer him with .
i was also annoy by the way he arrog address me in the familiar form .
he was onli a few year older than me and act like my lord and master - actual , comrad and master .
jovial , puffed-up , authoritarian , arrog , whatev suit him at ani given moment .
we all use the formal form to address him .
so be it , he 's the superintend .
actual , not everyon did , the chairman of the parti organis use to the familiar form to address him , and non-parti member , too .
the superintend , howev , address mani peopl in the familiar , especi those to whom he could appli his superior .
right now he was put me down for what was a lot of rubbish .
i thought someth about an ars and it was as much as i could not do to shout it in his face -
except that would mean that i would n't even return to pickax work on the line , never mind becom a railway offici .
how would i support two children ?
and the half-built hous !
i was readi to cri , but i control myself .
i would n't give him that pleasur .
`` that 's all for now , you can go , '' the superintend end the audienc and start again care examin the paperwork that he 'd had in his hand befor .
they summon me at half past eleven .
everyon from the offic was alreadi there and when i ask what was go on they repli , yeah , it ll be fine .
onli jožin said caustic how it had been his habit that they could n't fire all of us becaus the comrad superintend would have to do the work himself with his minion , and there was no risk of that .
here , he emphasis the word comrad ' , as if he knew what the superintend had put me down for in the morn .
it was quit the meet in the superintend 's offic .
the comrad superintend was sit behind his desk and behind the other desk were other comrad who were to decid on my futur as a civil servant .
the vet offic , chairman of the revolutionari trades-union committe , the record from the staf depart , the clerk for special purpos , someth like a counterintellig offic in the armi , and the deputi , my boss .
and the most import person , the chairman of the parti organis .
i knew him from the railway line .
a normal railway worker , who pack sleeper and shovel gravel .
and also a former guard .
there were rumour that back then there was no joke with him , he was a proper monster .
crook tongu claim that he 'd left school after seven year , had n't learnt anyth , could n't do anyth .
and when they close the jail he end up with a pickax work on the railway line .
but a comrad , yes , he was a dyed-in-the-wool comrad !
the superintend instruct me to sit down .
i had butterfli in my stomach and a lump in my throat .
the vet offic read the assess from the civic committe from my place of resid .

i had been a member of the town committe of the union of socialist youth , where i was chosen as a parti candid .
irrespect of my parent , who had left the parti , the parti put it trust in me .
but i got marri and , apart from at the nation committe offic , i also had a ceremoni in a church .
i 'd let down the parti 's trust in me in the worst way possibl .
becaus of this i had been remov from their list of candid .
but it was n't enough !
i had both of my children christen , and when my mother die , i even organis a church funer for her , even though she was a former parti member .
in do all of this i was show a negat attitud to the parti .
onc the vet offic had finish read , onli the tap of the superintend 's pencil on the tabl interrupt the tens silenc .
everyon look at me fix and i wish i was somewher veri far away .
dure this i had constant been silent repeat to myself `` communist - superpeopl , communist - superpeopl '' . what had i got myself into ?
whi had n't i stay with the blacksmith ?
i could have fix point without ani bloodi check .
but now ?
my career as a railway offic had finish earlier than it had start .
return to the brigad ?
that probabl wo n't work , the superintend ll definit kick me out for an hour .
`` comrad , how did you vet the comrad under discuss here ? '' the superintend interrupt the tens silenc with a question direct at the vet offic .
well , accord to the assess from his previous employ .
do you have it here ?
the vet offic was visibl in two mind .
there were bead of sweat on his templ and he was blink nervous , as if he himself was be vet .
he nod eager and pass a piec of paper to the superintend .
`` well , '' declar the superintend with a hint of jovial , which was , howev , often the harbing of a storm .
at first glanc noth but prais , graduat with distinct , studi industri colleg , work on commiss as a locksmith , met the quota with an averag of one hundr and twenti percent .
except the import stuff was miss .
where did you get that assess from , comrad ? '' he again turn to the vet offic , who felt as if the situat was start to turn against him and that veri soon he might not be a vet offic .
the comrad gave it to me when he join us .
is that suffici ?
`` well , when he join us , we went to do brigad work in the district , '' babbl the vet offic .
and there they do n't ask for assess , his was a kind of extra , so i put it into his folder .
`` so when you were put in a technic job this slip of paper was enough , '' said the superintend drili .
the vet offic blink nervous and could n't quit bring himself to answer .
`` it doe n't matter , we ll discuss it next time , '' said the superintend , close the matter . the vet offic was visibl reliev .
he 'd manag it for the time be .
`` what wrong with you , comrad ? '' ask the superintend , turn to me .
sudden he was address me in the formal , so i 'm finish !
my vision went dark and i start feel hot .
there follow a torrent of rebuk and accus and i knew that i was the most repugn creatur on earth , who did n't deserv the slightest merci .
in give him this incomplet assess i had led the comrad vet offic into error and not understood whi the assess was incomplet when i got it from the vet offic at the factori .
also that i was an anti-socialist element who , at the time of the build of socialist realism had support the whirl of religi obscurant , nay , taken part in it .
that i had commit mani thing , or was mayb commit now , and i silent pray for it to be over .
it was all one to me now .
i did n't care that i 'd be thrown out of my posit as a mechan offic .
i did n't care that they 'd take my pickax away from me .
that 's work for honest , decent peopl , not for enemi of the peopl , as i was in the eye of the comrad superintend .
`` that will be enough , comrad superintend , '' said the parti chairman sudden , emphat interrupt the superintend 's lectur .
here the comrad had made a mistak , a massiv mistak .
mistak ? it was noth but idioci !
and he got his punish !
do n't forget that , comrad superintend !
what can be wors for a young person than to close his door to the parti for a while !
to open them again , he would have to prove that he had chang , that he is again worthi of our trust .
the uneduc guard spoke like a book .
where did that come from ?
is he that well-read or was he parrot phrase from parti train cours and meet ?
that 's whi we must give that young comrad a chanc !
a chanc to show that he has chang .
and who els should give him that than you , comrad superintend ?
it is your respons to support this young , yes , somewhat confus comrad in his effort to reform !
it is your respons as a parti member , of which no-on can absolv you !
in fact , it the respons of us all as parti member .
here the comrad must see that the parti has not forgotten us .
that , as a care mother , it doe not just punish , but also love .
onc the chairman had finish , no-on said a word .
no-on had expect such a turnaround in the situat .
least of all me .
`` i agre with you entir , comrad chairman , '' said the superintend icili , nod in agreement , tri to take back the initi .
if you had let me finish , then you would have heard that i was get to exact this conclus .
everyon nod their head in agreement , but you could see that they did n't believ a singl word .
`` so i was confirm in the posit of independ clerk for the care of basic resourc , '' i whoop when i return to the offic , immedi burst into tear .
it was good that , apart from engin eva , everyon was at lunch .
she silent listen to my incoher descript of my recent experi , dure which time i calm down .
onc i 'd finish , she ask if i want a coffe .
without wait for an answer , she put water to boil and got the mug readi .
dure this she talk about vet practic .
about how they 'd give you one assess , often full of prais , and they 'd send the second one , full of dirt , to your new employ .
howev , i did n't end up where i should have done , but with a pickax on the railway line , so the comrad from the factori did n't know where to send it .
and our vet offic ?
he ll be worri about where he 'd eat or drink what , and eventu it turn out the way it did .
`` he ll catch it from the old man , '' she note malici .
he definit wo n't enjoy it today .
be care around him though , he 's quit veng .
and the parti chairman ?
basic much wors than the superintend , no altruist .
a zero with a pickax has great power .
the water for the coffe was start to boil and the offic soon fill with the scent of fresh pour coffe .
i threw a sugar cube into the mug and silent mix the hot brew .
perhap i was out of the wood .
they would n't fire me now , and the next check would n't be for three year .
in ani case , the comrad superintend would n't let me forget this day just like that .

villag symbol come to life
after year of inact , the wheel of the chlum windmil is again turn .
situat on a fifteen-metr high mast , it can be seen for mile around .
peopl from the surround area call it the chlum fan ' .
the windmil even found it way onto the coat of arm of the villag , popul 150 , which it was award in 2010 for the communiti 's homecom gather .
`` back then we appli for a coat of arm , and obvious we want the fan ' on that - everyon in the area know it , '' say villag mayor jiří mašek .
the chlum windmil is a local technolog monument .
one could also say that it is a memento of the present : it serv as a remind of the time when the local peopl fought for good-qual drinking-wat ,
which in the past was a rare occurr in chlum .
it was onli in 1910 that the local council settl on a solut that serv them well until the mid-1980 :
a seven-metr well was dug in the villag , which lie near the turn-off to číchov .
three year later the well was supplement with a metal structur and wind-pow pump for pump water into the reservoir at the highest point of the villag , close to the church .
`` the structur was built by the firm of antonín kunc from hranic na moravě at a cost of 2,400 crown , '' state the plaqu on the enclosur of the mast structur .
after sever repair and fall of the windwheel , the pump reach the end of it lifespan in 1971 .
7 may 1973 saw the open of a new chapter in the fight for water : on this day a new pipelin start serv chlum .
the wind-pow pump remain mere a non-funct symbol of the villag and local rariti .
the villag 's domin featur was put into oper at this year 's homecom gather .
it was onli in 2008 that the local inhabit decid to repair the windwheel and put it back into oper
and a replica of the origin wheel - smaller by half a metr - was order .
the wheel was mount on a mast , which howev had to be dismantl in the same year
as the produc of the wheel chose an unsuit materi , mean that the wheel was unabl to resist gust of wind .
the structur then laid under a roof , dismantl , for sever year .
howev , as of this year the wheel , mount on a high mast , is again turn .
on the occas of the homecom gather the villag had the replica wheel modifi and re-mount on top of an iron tower .
howev , the wheel onli pump water from the well to a blind spillway .
in the summer we disconnect it total becaus there was n't enough water in the well .
it pump empti .
`` in the autumn we ll then disconnect the shaft of the pump windwheel in the suction basket again , '' said mašek .
chlum is n't the onli villag in the czech republ that has a windwheel it coat of arm ; howev , it is the onli villag of this type in the whole of the vysočina region .
a similar element , honour a local technolog monument , can be found in the coat of arm of e.g . chvalkovic and zelená hora near vyškov , kuželov near hodonín , partutovic near přerov and polic near vsetín .

as a former journalist i must say that i 'm asham of my colleagu .
ecolog in practic
onc when i bought a flat in a high-ris i soon found that i was n't the onli inhabit .
silverfish move into my formica toilet .
pet silverfish , vermin with an imperfect transform , i.e . they do n't experi that transform from caterpillar to beetl , the young look like an adult , just veri small , and it grow .
i found them disgust and did n't shirk in get rid of them .
first by hand and then with chemic .
the socialist-era chemist 's gave me some blue crystal to get rid of them .
i think it was call zyklon b .
or someth els ?
but it success got rid of them .
i did someth similar with the pharaoh ant .
i use a box of juvenilis agent that would be taken by the ant would take to their nest and stop the queen from produc more young .
but i digress .
as time went by , the insect becom an object of admir for me and i increas came round to the opinion that they have the same right to life as us human .
furthermor , in my experi , interf with the ecosystem doe not lead to success and one pest can replac anoth .
it 's true , though , that with flea and bedbug i 'd have no problem worsen my karma by kill them .
at our new home my partner and i agre that , just so long as they were n't climb around our neck , they were free to tuck into fallen flake of skin , invis eyelash and so on .
after a while their peac exist was disrupt by a spider .
it was a normal type of corner-dwel that that settl in on the ceil .
we 'd thought that it live off normal fli and mosquito , which onli increas our comfort level .
becaus it was there for sever year , we found out that it main live off silverfish and that it evid kept their number to a bearabl level .
through close , regular contact while we were answer the call of natur we found out that it was a femal .
this was becaus we were wit to the romant courtship with a partner that was about a third her size . we saw him care pluck at the web filament so that he was n't gobbl up befor it got to the longed-for copul .
it took about three day , dure which they did n't move and did n't react to our check .
below the toilet bowl , where the romant game took place , we later found the dried-out remain of the male next to the femal .
after that the spider did n't move for week on end .
when we thought it was all over , we were surpris by a larg number of small spider dangl in various place around her .
they soon disappear .
some of them had been eaten by their mother and the other had scatter elsewher .
after a week , the femal herself disappear .
we do n't know whether she went somewher els or die , but after a month she re-appear on the ceil .
true , it was the somewhat smaller offspr , probabl daughter , of it ancestor from the toilet .
for a while she discreet follow our behaviour from the ceil and then move underneath the toilet bowl , judg our failur to attack her as friendship .
the larg number of somewhat more numer silverfish was again reduc and the spider quiet went about it busi of feed itself .
for a whole year our ecosystem did n't chang .
in that time our daughter reach the age where it 's embarrass to use a potti .
up until then we had toler it , but we were start to get fed up of constant empti the content .
we were ever-mor insist in get her to use the toilet .
howev , our daughter use the spider , which she had a veri good view of when wipe , as an excus to continu her bad habit .
she did n't accept it all when we said that have a spider in the hous was good luck .
by cri and scream she forc us to get the potti out .
there was noth els to do .
the moment arriv when the spider had to make way in the interest of our daughter progress in her develop .
it was up to me .
it was caught in a jar and banish somewher into the garden via the balconi .
i part from it as i would a friend , but after such a long time togeth i felt horribl , as if i was kick out a relat .
we assum that the silverfish would becom more common and start to reproduc by geometr progress .
and what do you know ? - a week went by , two week , and we did n't see a singl one .
i start to specul about the caus .
it occur to me that , follow the exampl of the ant , the spider had n't cultiv them there and that the environ of the toilet was n't as favour to their exist as we 'd thought .
but then the first medium-s one appear and soon it was swarm with them .
i had to think up anoth theori for their disappear and then i realis that their connect to the spider was that , when they could n't see it , they thought that it was hide somewher els and that danger could come from anywher .
or mayb they had some kind of telepath connect to their predat and it rapid disappear provok some panic respons in them .
i 'm am under no illus about their power of vision .
they show some indic of be scare of the light , but never react to me wave my hand or sudden movement .
our daughter now goe to the toilet regular .
i think she 's forgotten about the potti .
now we just need to attract anoth spider here .
i 'm now transmit my wish to the internet and i have they have n't turn their back on us after that evict .
otherwis we 'd have to use the zyklon b .
ten statement by albert einstein that enrich the world .
the thing said by the brilliant scientist from the last centuri will probabl never stop fascin human .
he immers himself so deepli in everyth that the result were alway incred revel .
albert einstein ( 1879 - 1955 ) was one of the most import scientist of all time .
he primarili enter public conscious through his special and general theori of relat , the best descript yet provid of the univers in it gigant dimens .
nor can one forget his elabor of the law of photoeffect or the idea of the quantis of electromagnet field .
there is no doubt that the descript itself and the system of find in the popular theori of relat is , for mani , so complex that they prefer to use easier point of refer for learn about it .
howev , it is not easi .
it would not be albert einstein , though , if he had n't found a brilliant solut to this , too : an hour close to your love one seem like a minut ; a minut in a hot oven seem like an hour - that is relat .
i have chosen ten out of his galaxi of famous quot that enthral me .
a clever person solv a problem . a wise person avoid it .
two thing are infinit :
the univers and human stupid ;
and i 'm not sure about the univers .
no amount of experiment can ever prove me right ;
a singl experi can prove me wrong .
what a sad era when it is easier to smash an atom than a prejudic .
if a clutter desk is a sign of a clutter mind , of what , then , is an empti desk a sign ?
i know not with what weapon world war iii will be fought , but world war iv will be fought with stick and stone .
there are a thousand way to kill time , but none to reviv it .
a littl knowledg is a danger thing . so is a lot .
if i were given an hour in which to do a problem upon which my life depend , i would spend 40 minut studi it , 15 minut review it and 5 minut solv it .
the hardest thing in the world to understand is incom tax .
to close , i ca n't not quot einstein 's formula for the definit of success : if we take a as success , the follow equat appli : a=x+y+z , where x is work , y is rest and z is to hold your tongu .

nobodi has explain to how i am suppos to keep refuge in the czech republ when they do n't want to live here .
follow a meet with his european counterpart minist for the interior milan chovanec ( čssd ) complain that other countri are put pressur on the czech republ to accept refuge distribut quota while reject ani discuss .
he also add that nobodi has yet explain how he is to keep alloc refuge in the czech republ when they do n't want to live there anyway .
`` we did n't get an answer , and we therefor request that quota were left out of the final text , '' said chovanec to journalist .
could you describ more specif the posit that you took into the meet of eu foreign and interior minist ?
we do not agre with mandatori quota or the system , which can not work .
we can not talk about migrant as if they were bag of salt or flour .
they are live be who have a vision , are go somewher , have relat .
what we want to hear from our colleagu was how they would keep migrant on the territori of member state if they were redistribut .
we can not imagin this .
we did n't get an answer , so we request that quota be left out of the final text .
we did not have ani problem with the other conclus from the meet - function hotspot , that is registr point , the protect of border , camp outsid europ , a trust fund for african countri and other matter .
we have been speak about this for a year and think that this is the way forward .
but to say that quota will solv everyth ?
not long ago we were discuss forti thousand , now it 's one hundr and twenti thousand .
when will it be five hundr thousand ?
and how will we keep those peopl in our countri ?
ninety-eight percent of peopl who pass through the czech republ want to go to germani .
almost no-on want to come here , we simpli do n't know how to keep them here .
other foreign , ukrainian , vietnames and other , for whom the czech republ is a destin countri , have ambit to come here ; they get asylum - but interest from this wave of migrat , that is from syria and other countri , is virtual zero .
you have said that refuge do not want to come to the czech republ , but we have alreadi undertaken to accept fifteen hundr peopl .
would n't it be possibl to accept more this way ?
we undertook to accept fifteen hundr peopl , but with condit .
we said : function hotspot , border protect , militari oper .
what will happen with that 1500 is that 1100 of them will undergo asylum proceed .
they will come to our detent facil and we will treat them the same as the one we have caught .
it 's a major issu and we ll discuss with europ whether we can hold peopl who are regist in itali , greec or hungari ,
becaus europ 's attitud is that if they re regist , they ca n't be held .
this mean that , if they enter our territori with registr , and if there 's an agreement , which there is n't yet , it could be that do n't even hold those 1100 on the territori of the czech republ and then they leav for germani onc they ve arriv .
if we re abl to hold them for the durat of their asylum proceed , we will start those proceed .
if they are citizen of syria or eritrea , then accord to european statist 98 percent of them get intern protect .
then they get document that allow them to travel in europ .
and i think that these peopl will then end up in destin countri .
then there are the four hundr peopl who ll be resettl here .
that 's the second project , which is just start at the moment , are there we onli progress in that we re debat with the church about the possibl for them find work , accommod and so on for them .
but that 's a veri long-term project .
you said that other countri were n't will to discuss the matter with us at the minist ' meet .
is n't it more the case that , not onli is the czech republ reject quota , it is also not offer solidarist measur that could unblock the discuss ?
and what kind of solidarist measur should that be , in your opinion ?
if the feder republ of germani issu an invit for all refuge from syria , that messag spread through all camp in not onli europ , but also turkey and jordan in a matter of hour .
it encourag a further wave of immigr toward germani , becaus they do n't want to come to the czech republ .
we think that the right path is the protect of extern border - to discourag these wave of migrat , help the needi and separ out the econom migrant .
to show them unambigu that they do n't have a chanc .
fifti thousand kosovar came to germani last year alon .
from safe kosovo , where we pay everyth in the countri , includ polic , the court and state attorney .
if could separ and not accept them , and accept them sole accord to econom need , then the fifti percent of what the social secur system pay out to them for noth could go toward refuge .
the number of peopl held in the czech republ increas the day after germani introduc check .
now it 's eighti , and on the first day it was twelv .
how far must it go befor border check becom even more stringent ?
we were worri about captur hundr of peopl .
these are the number that we can manag .
we still have sever hundr free space in brick-and-mortar detent facil .
obvious , everyon we catch will be return to austria within seven day .
that 's out standard procedur .
the austrian are the onli one who take them from us . with hungari it 's complic and the greek - that 's someth els entir .
where is the tip point ?
a thousand a day ?
i think it would have to be sever hundr a day .
two hundr , three hundr peopl on two , three consecut day exhaust our capac suffici that we have to resort to crisi plan .
i have an agreement with the prime minist that we would then immedi call an emerg govern meet .
he take a consider interest in the whole issu , and we talk on the ophon sever time per day .
should that situat aris , the govern can de facto meet immedi and a singl rule would decid on reinforc for the polic and armi , let 's say the custom servic , and mayb the prison servic .
is an extrem option the state of emerg that has been call in some part of hungari ?
i do n't think it ll go that far here .
you must realis that we are in a differ posit , we are a landlock state within the european union . our one and onli schengen border is at the airport .
i do n't know what would have to occur for this to happen on the territori of the czech republ . i do n't want to scaremong .
all the inform that we have , be it from moldova , serbia or hungari , indic that the hungarian are tri to divert the flow of migrat to croatia and slovenia , which would then mean a direct rout into austria .
this would onli margin concern the czech republ - hard at all .

at this time last year , fedex announc it would hire 50,000 season worker for the holiday .
it share fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minut ahead of wednesday 's open bell .
fedex corp. said that it expect to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year that end next may , down 20 cent from an earlier predict .
analyst expect $ 10.84 , accord to a survey by factset .
the reduc outlook come despit rate hike averag 4.9 percent , which will take effect jan. 4 , and higher surcharg for ground shipment of heavi or larg packag , which begin in novemb .
the compani said it still expect earn to grow over the previous year becaus of cost-cut , higher revenu and growth in onlin commerc .
chairman and ceo fred smith said the compani was `` perform solid given weaker-than-expect econom condit , especi in manufactur and global trade . ''
the holiday-hir plan were announc a day after rival up said that that it plan to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra worker , about the same that it hire last year .
in the quarter that end aug. 31 , fedex earn $ 692 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earn per share amount to $ 2.42 , short of the $ 2.44 per share averag forecast of 12 analyst survey by zack invest research .

six analyst survey by zack expect $ 12.23 billion .
fedex has been hit in recent year by a declin in prioriti intern ship , which has caus revenu in it express unit to stagnat .
but the boom in onlin shop has boost result at fedex ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenu rose 29 percent but oper incom was basic flat on higher cost for larger packag and self-insur .
the express unit saw higher incom becaus of higher base rate , while incom fell in the freight busi on higher labor cost .
in premarket trade about an hour befor the open bell , fedex share were down $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
they close tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on june 11 .
at their most anticip meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week seat around a 27-foot honduran mahogani tabl decid if it 's time to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
loom over them at one end of the central bank 's ornat , two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to put the nation 's econom interest abov all other .
the central bank has a dual charg from congress : maxim u.s. employ and keep price here stabl .
but sinc the great recess , fed leader have acknowledg that there 's an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and that third mandat could be the x-factor in a too-close-to-predict decis , to be announc thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to start be wean from the unpreced stimulus provid by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
even though most data show the economi grow solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market could make already-cauti fed offici skittish about ad to the volatil by rais their benchmark feder fund rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious the labor market and inflat is go to be first and foremost the most import thing they watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais the rate , the increas uncertainti surround the global marketplac is enough to provid them with justif to wait further , '' she said .
there 's no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is caus financi market jitter .
about half of economist survey recent by bloomberg predict a rate increas this week .
financi market , howev , are expect the fed to hold off , with a key indic show onli about a 30 % chanc of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed rais the rate , unless policymak were to soften the blow by promis that anoth increas would be a way off .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228.89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that fed policymak will hold the rate steadi this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed hike rate at this point in time , '' he said .
if fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to great length in their polici statement to hold financi market ' hand so they do n't panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seem on track to rais the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would valid the strength of the u.s. recoveri .
yellen had said through the spring and earli summer that she expect a rate increas this year despit complaint from liber that more econom progress was need .
although job creation slow in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate drop to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year and near the level the fed consid to be full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and although inflat continu to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , fed policymak said a key reason was the temporari effect of sharpli lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate , and need them , given the tight of the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world start convuls late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag drop as much as 16 % below it record high in may as investor fear a slow chines economi would drag down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , with the dow now down near 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymak , the market turmoil add to the complex calculus of when to rais the interest rate .
`` absent what happen in financi market and the news about the weak in the chines economi over the past coupl week , they would be tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he predict they ll wait at least a month to get a better handl on the effect .
`` there 's a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the u.s. economi are go to be , and they have almost no data to reli on that post-dat the develop in china , '' olin said .
the health of the global economi is n't one of the fed 's primari concern , so technic it should n't be factor into it decision-mak .
but , in effect , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint by then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed might `` taper '' it monetari expans trigger market convuls around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , fed offici can be expect not onli to monitor the develop elsewher but also to consult with other central banker and expert to get a better read on the global economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of overreact to financi market movement that seem unconnect to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe who has been push for a rate increas , cite decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
a financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over three meet `` despit limit identifi implic for u.s. growth , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici revers those cut .
the fed should put financi stabil concern first onli dure a major crisi , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's rate-set committe .
the latest turmoil doe n't come close to that level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be put in a situat of be scare of a rate hike becaus market got upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv act still has the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that is chang , i do n't think they should get ahead of the curv .

most of them are young black men .
nor do you see footag from calai , where these black and dark-skin men are wait to see if they can get through the channel tunnel .
but that 's not so touch .
even those pictur of the primit christian church set up by the eritrean did n't make such a big impress on european .
it seem too fals .
when they re talk about refuge quota , they somehow fail to mention that it 's just about those poor children from syria , but also those stylish - for those of an older generat : fashion attir - young men ,
who with their muscl look like they just step out of a fit centr .
here 's a person experi .
this summer we were lie on the privat beach of a hotel in the turkish - muslim - part of cyprus .
regardless of the fact that it was a privat beach , sudden a larg group of car arriv .
they were n't exact old banger .
some young black peopl got out of them .
about thirti men and five women .
age between 15 and 30 .
they went onto the beach , all of them dress in design cloth and shoe . hold , of cours , smartphon .
no-on care about the fact that it was a privat beach - not even the employe - turk , muslim ! - they were evid afraid of them .
they took over all the sun lounger .
if you were n't lie on one and were in the sea , bad luck .
they were dress like someth out of an american rapper film .
hat and nail on their head , white and colour adida trainer on their feet .
then they took over the local beach bar and start parti .
they took over the tabl round about and squeez in next to the sit dark-skin and white - i.e . muslim and european - custom without ask .
mother and children ran away from the dine patio to somewher quiet .
the black who had arriv drank beer straight from small bottl - like in american serial ? ! - they discard the empti bottl on the beach round about them .
they were constant shout loud at one anoth .
not in english of cours .
then they start drink wine , also straight from the bottl .
they jump into the hotel swimming-pool - in design swimwear , especi the young ladi - scream and shout in the water , while mother and children and pension ran away , terrifi , and after half an hour there was n't a singl non-black person on the beach or in the pool .
everyon had disappear .
regardless of whether they were christian or muslim .
the hotel employe were scare to even talk about them .
the waiter said to me in a low voic : `` did you see the gold they had on them ? ''
`` yeah , '' i said .
`` they definit did n't get that from work , '' said the waiter .
i rememb : `` i know , they all had massiv gold chain around their neck .
and one had a massiv gold cross , mayb twenti centimetr long , on his neck .
and the women were dress like in a goldsmith 's .
`` are they drug smuggler ? '' i ask .
`` you saw how they were booz , '' repli the waiter .
they do n't smuggl or use drug .
they smuggl someth els entir .
then it was clear to me what they were smuggl .
howev , in june 2105 [ sic ] that was n't yet so import to me .
i had no idea what was to follow .
but the secret servic and lead politician should be the first to know .
i do n't think they would n't know .
at that time about 1.5 million immigr were on their way to europ .
and they come and come and come .
now we have seen that the chief problem of the european union is that it is the milit polit correct politician pretend to be intellectu and the lobbi and econom group associ with them that hold the greatest power .
germani and it politician - nowaday public recognis as the main forc in europ - lie , lie and lie - and not just them , as well as eu head of state and televis , includ our .
for exampl , the recent televis footag of the enthusiast welcom of refuge is on the level of footag shown on russian televis in august 1968 .
of cours there were a few trendi liber at the station , but main it was - establish german - muslim that were welcom them .
for week on a lot of nonsens was spoken on czech televis about how , accord to some survey or other , almost all german were in favour of welcom emigr .
howev , anyon who has spent just a few day in germani know that this is a massiv lie .
this is confirm by further inform ,
for exampl the famous public opinion survey conduct by ard , the consortium of public broadcast in germani .
even a week ago it was still be claim by ard that more than 50 % of german want to accept even more refuge .
this was also report on czech televis .
howev , they kept quiet about what broke the next day in germani : an opinion poll show that 94.5 percent of german did n't want to accept ani more immigr - 67,000 peopl took part in the poll .
it is true that five year ago , in 2010 , chancellor merkel declar public : `` our effort to establish a multi-culti ' societi have total fail . ''
she further said : `` germani is give up the fight for a multicultur societi . ''
`` all effort for such coexist have fail total . ''
accord to merkel , in a countri with four million muslim , the strategi that allow peopl from vari cultur environ to live alongsid one anoth without integr has not prove success . today they live here with us and we have lie to ourselv for some time that they will not stay , and go away again some day .
this is not , howev , the realiti .
the multicultur approach , when we tell ourselv that we will just live happili alongsid one anoth , has fail .
it has fail complet .
howev , even merkel probabl doe not have the power to oppos those hold the power in germani and europ , and main polit correct .
this is shown in the escal of event .
conflict is rapid increas .
the eurogerman schulz , presid of the european parliament , mep for the spd , is alleg the onli member of the parliament who doe not have a school-leav certif - yes , he is the one about whom berlusconi said in the eu parliament that he could play a concentration-camp guard - has made a spectacl of himself sever time .
it appear , particular in light of recent statement by german politician , that germani has cross the rubicon .
we must take note that , apart from some , the major of european politician do not support these statement and that the politician of countri that were the victim of nazism are horrifi .
what has happen to the german ?
the rich , success and reliabl german ?
those who for year tri , at least outward ? to come to term with their terribl past as aggressor and murder of million ?
are those who say that it is part of the soul of germani to sow the seed of aggress , superior and violenc , right ?
was chancellor otto von bismarck right when he exert all his power to prevent advoc of the greater german solut to german unif from take control of the whole centr of europ ?
when he said that the greater german idea would destroy germani ?
probabl .
onc he was depos , prepar start for the first world war .
the greater german idea , which led the german and europ into two world war and cost million of live , has probabl return in anoth form .
follow marxist attempt to take over the countri , for exampl with the rote arme fraktion , after the failur of the gdr , a new german ideolog , base for exampl on ecolog , which was , for exampl , one of the chief ideolog branch of nazism , start to develop .
we could call it trendi liber .
the german elit long prevent the creation of german nation , and therefor left all the fighter against atom power , enthusiast seek paradis for all in peac and tacit support the old imperi and nazi slogan unser wald muss leben ( our forest must live ' ) .
to appeas the restless young peopl who , all over the world , want to do thing differ and better , they fulli went over to the side of those fight against global warm , close nuclear power plant , etc .
in this they forgot that within this stream of thought there is also a strong antisemit - pro-palestinian - and anti-slavon element , consid all slav to be troublesom vermin - that goe right back to karl marx , a jew by descent , who was main a german nationalist .
as shown in recent statement by schulz and german minist , open threaten the disobedi eastern countri , this also includ the idea of germani in a lead role ,
and which must be listen to without excus ,
or woe betid you !
when we add to this the fact that immigr are a high suggest group of voter , we have what we have .
stand behind this is , as ever , capit , particular german capit , which suit it and which live off the fact that , through the bank and union , germani actual control the major of state of the european union .
the pseudobelief of trendi liber first led german into the swamp of ecolog and multicultur and has now brought them , and may still bring them , million of muslim
who , attract by the siren call , will soon run up against the wall of realiti that merkel doe want to see , and will start to rebel .
again , germani can onli threaten it neighbour with forc , again it can ideolog captiv part - and it appear that it is an increas small part - of it popul ; howev , realiti will , as ever , catch up with it .
will germani burn again ?
muslim shelter are alreadi burn .
what will the german govern do when public protest break out in germani against the come islamist ?
islamist who will be aid by muslim who have been live in germani for year , but have not been integr so that they accept local habit and law ?
what will the german govern do when it admit naturalis muslim , islamist who have arriv in the countri and german , follow the islamis of their countri with fear ?
what will happen to german , and germani itself , when peopl rise who loud and public protest against the new euro-superhuman , the muslim ?
germani has simpli chang .
the conflict that it has provok through it support of trendi liber ideolog , i.e . ideolog that is elitist and , in essenc , totalitarian , and of it insati bank , will grow .
and , thank to it rude behaviour toward disobedi , democrat german and all of it inferior , disobedi eastern neighbour , this can not end well .
final part tomorrow .

for mild obes diabet , weight loss surgeri may be help
the benefit of weight loss surgeri for mild obes peopl with type 2 diabet can last at least five year , accord to a new studi .
it 's still to earli to say whether mild obes peopl with diabet live longer after weight loss surgeri than those who receiv non-surg treatment , howev .
`` the mortal data take a long time to show up , '' said dr. robin blackston , a weight loss surgeri expert who wrote an editori on the new studi in jama surgeri .
weight loss oper , or bariatr surgeri , use various method to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduc hunger and limit the bodi 's abil to absorb food .
over the year , bariatr surgeri have prove effect for treat type 2 diabet , but most studi were done in peopl who are morbid obes , with a bodi mass index ( bmi ) of 35 or abov .
bmi , a measur of weight in relat to height , is consid normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a bmi of 25 or higher indic that someon is overweight , and peopl with a bmi over 30 are consid obes .
you can calcul your bmi here : 1.usa.gov/1d0zqdv .
for the new studi , research from taiwan 's min-sheng general hospit use data collect sinc 2007 in a trial compar two kind of bariatr surgeri - gastric bypass and sleev gastrectomi - to medic treatment for type 2 diabet in peopl who were mild obes .
the averag bmi among those who had surgeri fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the studi .
meanwhil , the bmi among those receiv non-surg diabet treatment stay about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgeri , diabet resolv complet in 36 percent and partial in 28 percent .
in the medically-tr group , by comparison , diabet resolv complet in onli 1 percent and partial in onli about 2 percent .
in addit , control of blood pressur , triglycerid , and `` bad '' ldl cholesterol `` was general better in the surgic group , '' the author found .
the research also monitor patient ' blood level of hemoglobin a1c , which reflect blood sugar level over time .
hemoglobin a1c is best kept below 7 percent , the research write .
after surgeri , the averag hemoglobin a1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medic therapi group , howev , it remain steadi at about 8 percent .
but this better `` glycem control '' - as reflect by the improv hemoglobin a1c level - did not reduc the mortal rate at five year , accord to lead research dr. chih-cheng hsu and colleagu .
the research team also compar averag outcom with the two type of surgeri .
at the fifth year , compar to the sleev gastrectomi group , the bypass surgeri group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs 14.2 kg ) , achiev larger drop in bmi ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in hemoglobin a1c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more like to have complet diabet remiss ( 46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent ) .
while the new studi doe not show a surviv benefit or surgeri after five year , there is evid from a studi of heavier peopl in sweden that surgeri doe lead to a longer life , say blackston , of the univers of arizona colleg of medicine-phoenix .
in the swedish studi , obes peopl who had bariatr surgeri were about 29 percent less like to die over 15 year , compar to a group who tri more convent method .
though the new studi did n't show a benefit in surviv among surgeri patient , blackston said it 's reassur for peopl with a bmi under 35 interest in the procedur .
`` this is where this paper is critic , becaus it say this surgeri is safe in that lower bmi group , '' with no increas risk of death or renal diseas , she said .
blackston ad that peopl and their doctor should start take weight serious onc the patient 's bmi fall between 27 and 30 .
`` i think we wait too long to get peopl to be serious about this , '' she said .
i think that onc they ve accumul these genet chang that hardwir their bodi into obes and diabet , revers that is realli hard .

i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison author say i can not be both a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be allow a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to tri to rememb all the detail .

here 's the lesson .
tell the inmat 's stori the way he like it , get access .
i complain to her .

there will be other report you can turn to for that .

`` that keep come up - i did n't hear trent robinson bring up wrestl when they beat us 24-2 , '' bellami said on wednesday .
i can guarante we have n't chang noth all year with our defens system or techniqu , it 's just that the last six week we have made a real emphasi with our contact in tackl and that has been the turn around for us .
trent has been there three year and he obvious has a great side to coach so he is probabl not use to lose so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it 's funni how this alway come up at this time of year .

but now he has a team which can play what we would see as excit footi , especi his young halv with their speed .
that 's the footi you would want to play when you have those sort of player .
he made that point in 2010 , now he want everyon to play his style of footi - not everi team has two halv like anthoni milford and ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it build more confid becaus they are say these thing becaus they are a littl bit concern about play us .
six week ago they probabl were n't think of us when they get to the big game .

the bronco game was probabl a good game , i have n't watch it yet but what was the score ? 16-12 ?
our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tri in our game but is that excit footi ?
or is it make break and not score tri that is excit ?
to me it 's agenda .
if they are mention us it mean that at some stage we might meet them there .
the storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either north queensland cowboy or cronulla shark in next saturday night 's preliminari final at aami park with ticket on sale from next tuesday morn .
