8 poll number that show donald trump is for real
some have tri to label him a flip-flopp .
other have dismiss him as a joke .
and some are hold out for an implos .
but no matter how some republican are tri to drag donald trump down from atop the poll , it has n't work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 nation poll have shown donald trump 's lead at doubl digit , and some are start to ask serious what it mean for the real estat mogul 's nomin chanc .
of cours , it 's still earli in the elect cycl .
none of this is to say that trump is like to win the republican nomin .
pundit point out that at this time in 2011 , rick perri 's lead was give way to a rise herman cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomin process .
and there are mani reason he would struggl in a general elect .
but outsid group like jeb bush 's super pac and the econom conserv group club for growth are recogn trump 's stay power and begin to unload their dollar to toppl him .
here are some recent poll number that suggest that the real estat mogul is n't just a pass phase :
trump 's favor rate have turn 180 degre .
right befor donald trump announc his candidaci in mid-jun , a monmouth univers poll show onli two in 10 republican had a posit view of the real estat mogul .
by mid-juli , it was 40 percent .
in earli august , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 republican have a favor view of donald trump .
rough three in 10 say they have a negat view .
and these number hold up in earli state .
a quinnipiac poll in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republican there had a favor view of trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as the nomine .
in a cnn/orc poll last week , 67 percent of republican said they would be either `` enthusiast '' or `` satisfi '' if trump were the nomine .
onli two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nomine .
onli ben carson generat rough the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiast '' vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with onli 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of republican voter say they would be `` dissatisfi '' or `` upset '' if establish favorit jeb bush becom the nomine .
a major of republican do n't see trump 's tempera as a problem .
while donald trump has been wide critic for his bombast and insult , 52 percent of lean republican voter nationwid think that the real estat mogul has the right tempera to be presid , accord to monday 's abc news/washington post poll .
the same number hold in the first-in-the-n caucus state of iowa , where the same 52 percent of republican think he has the person to be command in chief , accord to quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doe n't have the person to serv effect , and almost six in 10 independ say his tempera doe not belong in the white hous , accord to abc/post .
republican voter are get use to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hat , republican voter think trump is for real .
when ask who is most like to win the gop nomin , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , accord to a cnn/orc poll out last week .
that 's a chang from when four in 10 place their money on jeb bush in late juli .
full disclosur : gop voter have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycl , four in 10 republican pick rick perri to win the nomin , vs. onli 28 percent for eventu nomine mitt romney .
still , it show that a plural of gop voter see trump 's campaign as plausibl .
even if republican ralli around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some pundit point out that the splinter field is like contribut to trump 's lead , while anti-trump support is be spread diffus among more than a dozen other candid .
but a monmouth univers poll in earli septemb show that , in a hypothet head-to-head matchup between trump and most other republican candid , trump almost alway garner major support .
he lead car fiorina by 13 point , marco rubio by 14 point , walker by 15 point , jeb bush by 19 point , and , final , rand paul , john kasich and chris christi by 33 point each .
he 's in a dead heat with ted cruz .
the onli candid who beat him ?
ben carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 point in a hypothet head-to-head .
a bare major of donald trump 's support say they ve made up their mind .
a new cbs/nyt poll out on tuesday show that just more than half of voter who support trump say they have lock in their vote .
obvious , a lot can happen to chang that , and no one can realli say they would never chang their mind .
46 percent said they are leav the door open to switch candid .
still , trump 's strongest competit at the moment is from fellow outsid neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who say they have made up their mind are twice as like to go for trump .
six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr .
even sinc donald trump call immigr from mexico `` rapist '' in his campaign announc speech two month ago , immigr has been front and center in the 2016 convers .
some are worri that trump 's bombast will drive crucial hispan voter away from the republican parti and damag rebrand effort .
but accord to monday 's new abc/post poll , six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr issu .
so as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , it seem donald trump will remain too .
frustrat with govern is climb to new high .
donald trump and ben carson now account for rough half of the support from republican voter , larg due to their outsid status .
six in 10 republican in monday 's new abc/post poll say they want a polit outsid over someon with govern experi .
and they are angri at washington , too .
a des moin register/bloomberg poll in iowa from two week ago show that three in four iowa republican are frustrat with republican in congress , with 54 percent `` unsatisfi '' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . ''

here 's what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will climb and the economi will slip into a recess .
this we know .
what we do n't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economi specif , histori offer littl guid about time .
a recess has come as quick as 11 month after the first rate hike and as long as 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , a determin in how the economi and financi asset respond .
that 's whi offici at the u.s. central bank have stress so vigor that investor should not be focus on when it start rais rate but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are , inde , multipl variabl at play .
in the end , howev , market particip may find that all the rate-hik fuss may have been overdon .
`` the first hike from the fed sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as signal the end of the era of cheap money , ' `` julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom , said in a note to client .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rate to more normal but still low level to be the seismic shock that mani seem to fear .
that 's not to say there wo n't be effect , howev .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi could react , base on histor trend :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip of rate hike can make thing volatil for a while .
onc the hike hit , though , the impact is not as dramat .
`` it doe seem there is a trend for equiti return to stall 12-24 month after the first hike , which again perhap reflect the lag in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi of what happen after the fed hike .
more specif , the market over the past 35 year or so is most often up sharpli - about 14 percent - head into the rate hike , fair flat in the 250 day after ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal onc 500 day have pass , with averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi bob doll , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , post on barron 's .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to get more pronounc later in the rate-hik cycl and return begin to diminish .
recess are a fact of econom life , but rate hike often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is face some condit that did not exist befor and could hasten a recess .
most notabl , gross domest product will be near it lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , in the 118 rate hike sinc 1950 , onli twice has nomin year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter track at just 1.5 percent , accord to the atlanta fed .
hike rate into such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and set up the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip have been brace for a fed hike all year , with all eye turn toward this week 's feder open market committe meet , which end thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv a hike at this meet , futur trade indic just a 25 percent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all hike cycl to date have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp eclips prerecess peak veri quick post the recoveri commenc , '' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest the fed has wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record had been 35 month , and this is 74 month and count .
fix incom also has been volatil as the market anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equiti experi .
the princip differ is that the impact happen faster in bond than stock when the fed chang cours in polici .
for bond , it doe seem yield chang direct immedi as the first hike/cut in the cycl arriv .
at the end of the hike cycl bond yield fall immedi , '' deutsch said .
charl schwab strategist believ the hike in rate will caus yield between longer- and shorter-d bond to move closer togeth , flatten the curv .
high-yield bond often perform better in such a climat , though `` we are still cautious about stretch for yield , '' kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab , said in an analysi .
interest , jone think market alreadi have adapt to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread have widen and volatil has increas - all characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad speak , compani that do the major of their busi in the u.s. will win as interest rate rise and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt will fare wors , as a rise dollar make their product more expens in the global market space and their debt more expens the financ .
`` histori show that qualiti ' stock tend to outperform dure the three month follow an initi rate hike , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report for client .
firm with strong balanc sheet outpac weak balanc sheet compani follow each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hike , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit as well as low volatil stock also outperform their lower qualiti counterpart , by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) , respect .
debt will becom a big issu .
compani with a high percentag of float rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outsid pure stock play , consum stand to benefit as well through the rise dollar .
saver could see gain as well through higher yield at the , though expert differ on how quick that will take hold .

sak and other labour market organis head start to ach immedi , and as a result , the countri stand still on friday thank to employe massiv demonstr .
mani think that also common sens come to a standstil then .
the question is if it is worth go on a strike , when the thing are alreadi go bad .
some have even organis a resist movement .
onlin over 50,000 peopl have announc that they will not take part in the demonstr but will go to work .
dure the good old consensus time , this would have been imposs .
of cours there was no internet where one could protest , but open proclaim to be a strike-break would have been a polit suicid for an ordinari person .
this protest of a few ten of thousand of peopl is of littl concern to trade union with million of member , but it will give them someth to think about .
the posit of labour movement is not as axiomat as it still was two decad ago .
not everyon can identifi with the goal of the movement , the valu have chang
from the point of view of the labour movement appeal , the govern harsh solut can also be seen as an absolut heaven-s .
after thing have seem to be driven by their own momentum for year , final the union can get down to busi : to protect the right of an employe , explicit and proper .
this way the govern may unintent strengthen the role of the labour movement , as membership in a trade union can be perhap seen as more necessari than befor .
whatev the opinion on the organis action , the idea that the demonstr on friday would somehow stop finland is nonsens .
finland has stop alreadi some time ago .
for exampl , industri product has been declin for 31 consecut month .
the gdp is still drop and unemploy rise .
you would think these thing are a headach to everyon .

in addit , the goal is to save 2 million from other activ .
the background to the cooper negoti is the budget for 2016 , which forecast a deficit of about 8.5 million to the actual oper .
the govern cut also have an effect .
dure this financi year , the univers will make a deficit of about 2.6 million .
for next year , the cost will go slight up , but at the same time the financ from the ministri will be cut by 2 million and other financ by 3.2 million .

the massiv cut target at teach and research as well as the reduct of corpor financ have a signific joint effect on our univers , state rector ann pauli in the univers press releas .
befor the summer the effect of the cut seem more moder , but now the reduct of addit financ is shown in new proport .

sure david cameron know the lorax better than this ?
it 's one thing ani parent soon learn : when your child love a book , it wo n't be long befor you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seem , you are david cameron .
ask by a provid of holiday childcar scheme to name his favourit kid ' book , the prime minist opt for the lorax , the 1971 environment fabl by dr seuss .
it was a difficult choic , cameron write in a messag publish on the websit of the supercamp compani , continu : `` funni , move , creativ and with a power messag , it 's one i enjoy read to my children becaus there alway seem to be an imag or a messag that we have previous miss . ''
all veri well , except that the subsequ paragraph in which cameron suppos describ the plot of the book instead give a précis of the 2012 film version , which ad new charact and detail to pad out the fair brief origin text .
`` set in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where all natur has gone and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey , by fulfil her wish to see a real tree , '' it read , chronicl a love interest unknown to dr seuss , real name theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
if that was n't suspici enough , cameron 's submit text read in part like a plot summari of the lorax film provid on the internet movi databas websit , which begin : `` in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where everyth is artifici and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey . ''
given he is an avow hands-on parent , it seem unlik cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnam boy hear how the local environ was devast by the avarici , tree-chop , thneed-knit once-l , despit the protest of the eponym lorax , a squat , moustachio creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like , such a relat lowli pr task would have been outsourc to an aid , seem one who has never read the lorax 20 time in a row to a child .
a down street spokeswoman said the text was believ to have come from cameron 's constitu offic .
supercamp confirm that the text was provid from cameron 's staff , but had no further immedi comment .
adam lyth was clear at risk of england omiss but it 's still tough
take on pakistan in the unit arab emir is a tough assign but after see the squad england have select for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat suffer last time doe not look on the card for me .
i would n't rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago but there are good player of spin in that bat lineup and the collect mindset is strong ; they will not carri scar from 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali is develop as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop from england test squad and replac by alex hale
the decis to omit adam lyth is obvious a tough one for me to analys as his head coach at yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are judg on output .
there were no question mark over joe root , for exampl , lead up to the announc becaus - and i have said this befor - player are their own best selector .
a coupl of half-centuri and lyth might have seen his run extend but he was in control of his own destini .
hope if he punch out more run for yorkshir anoth opportun will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud even when he was not perform as well as he can and that doe not surpris me ; he is a team man abov all els .
the question of how long a test batsman get to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven cap - like sam robson befor him - while nick compton got nine .
onli compton got the chanc home and away .
the onli gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wast opportun is in the past now .
alex hale come in and he is a batsman i rate high .
he is an x-factor cricket , which we at yorkshir saw earli this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch that was do a bit .
he must at least be afford the same opportun as those befor him but this will of cours depend on the make-up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen open the bat alongsid cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keep four quick , has been float and it is not someth i am against .
i do n't see whi a strokemak can not bat there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he is one hell of a cricket .
moeen may not have done the job for his counti , worcestershir , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much differ .
my old team-mat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop befor step up to open in 2001 .
he peel off three centuri immedi and did not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limit deal with him , he has struck me as veri impress young man .
peopl may look at his raw stat - averag 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a heap of spinner put their hand up and selector have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a coupl of shrewd addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the game 's loveliest bloke , who will bring a wealth of experi have done it in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood come in for the white-bal leg of the tour and will bring both energi and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i alway felt he was born to be involv in intern cricket , be it play or coach , and like mahela has nous that can be tap .
sometim new voic in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with what has been said befor , can freshen up a side .
colli 's durham team-mat ben stoke is rest for the one-day , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issu with this .
while not everyon will agre , the coach and selector do not set the schedul .
and you have to rememb , like player , their job are depend on result .
such decis are never taken light .
brexit camp might win the day if economi is in doldrum by 2017
david cameron 's half-bak renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu get deeper into troubl with everi day that pass , even without the elect of genial jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cut up rough over europ on tuesday .
foreign have their corbyn and nigel farag too .
a european diplomat chum explain the other day that , sunk in assort crise as the eu is - not all of their own make - some member state are fed up with britain 's self-absorb agenda of divis concess and disrupt treati chang which they most do n't want .
in brighton for it annual bean , the tuc decid it did n't want them either if they erod social protect .
we could even call it dave and georg 's selfi agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summit or bilater session in foreign capit , take a photo of themselv in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grande , then come home and say they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european pal , who want an outward-look britain insid the eu tent - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that more short-sight minist and offici in some capit have got to the point where they do n't care whether we stay or leav .
angela merkel , germani 's cautious level-head chancellor , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year and want to leav offic befor it goe bad for her , as it did for overstay thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
franc 's françoi holland is face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
he is a fade forc too .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern of the right , spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them break a leg to help the selfi brit , whose energi might be better spent prevent scotland leav the uk - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some such minist may even be plan to make deliber unhelp remark , snp-style , dure the uk 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggest .
`` the renegoti was a fix '' and `` britain got noth of valu out of the renegoti . ''
the european know to their cost how predatori fleet street can be and how eu-scept the oligarch press baron are , as they were not dure the toni benn-inspir 1975 referendum which endors our 1973 entri by a ratio of 2:1 .
they may dim rememb bori johnson , the arch euro-opportunist , make his name as an `` eu straight banana '' brussel correspond in the earli 90s .
for all his foolish ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
they includ the medley of tax-shi rascal , phone-hack foreign and pseudo non-dom who own most of our great newspap .
actual toni blair thought much the same about them , but realis that when you re in a cage with a randi gorilla you have to pass the banana to distract it from have you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairit than blair in oppos cameron 's referendum wheez , sinc blair had conced the principl over the eu 's abort constitut , sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgav him that either .
but nice jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back at westminst on monday - i told him he no longer has time to wast on me - seem to be in danger of re-adopt neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of the 80s , a mistak then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coher strategi to engag with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacat on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit on europ is what i will kind call evolv .
he say he 'd like us to stay in a reform eu .
well , most peopl outsid ukip 's woad-wear tendenc and the wilder shore of tori littl englander can probabl say yes to that .
it 's what hilari `` a benn , but not a bennit '' benn said on radio and tv this week as the boy scout in him struggl not to admit that corbyn 's appoint of abras john mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it remind me of the 70s , when his old dad struggl on tv to be disloy to labour cabinet colleagu without go too far and lose his cabinet job .
hilari 's struggl was more attract .
but fight to stay in `` in all circumst '' - benn 's phrase - was not what mcdonnel was say , nor what jc told peer and mps at their privat meet on monday night , by all account .
whatev the bottom-up , touchy-fe imag corbyn want to convey - rememb , he even touch me - messag disciplin remain import in the age of 24/7 tv and especi in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it 's fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europ , allow him to take labour 's support for grant in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel has said .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnel and corbyn 's basic equivoc about eu membership - consist with their bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among leftw dissid for whom the narciss of small differ is a central tenet of doctrin squabbl .
as with his equivoc over nato - tom watson is adam that jc wo n't campaign to quit - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to make sens of it all for their master at home .
whi should pari or berlin wast polit capit - they have suspici voter too - on concess to britain when it may all be pointless ?
the us is alreadi pretti disappoint with the brit '' feebl militari perform in iraq , libya and syria , even with a cost-cut tori govern in power , as i was remind at the launch of someth call the british influenc secur forum on monday .
expert criticis public health england e-cigarett review
claim by a government-fund agenc that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke aros from a meet of 12 peopl , some with link to the tobacco industri , research have said .
expert write in the british medic journal ( bmj ) join the lancet in criticis the evid use by public health england ( phe ) in it report on e-cigarett .
phe publish the `` landmark '' report last month , describ it as a `` comprehens review of the evid . ''
but sever research have question the robust of the data and point to link between some expert and the tobacco industri .
an editori in the lancet medic journal last month attack the `` extraordinarili flimsi foundat '' on which phe base it main conclus .
write in the bmj , two further research have question whether the claim were `` built on rock or sand . ''
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
they said the public would expect phe 's claim that `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' would be base on a detail review of evid and model .
in fact , it come from a singl meet of 12 peopl conven to develop a multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) model to synthesis their opinion on the harm associ with differ nicotine-contain product ; the result of the meet were summaris in a research paper .
mckee and capewel said one sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose chief execut was report to have previous receiv fund from british american tobacco for an independ studi .
he also endors bat 's public health credenti in a sustain report , they said .
one of the 12 peopl at the meet declar fund from an e-cigarett manufactur but not the fund he was report to have receiv previous from the tobacco compani philip morri intern , they ad .
the rational for select the member of the panel is not provid , but they includ sever known e-cigarett champion , some of whom also declar industri fund in the paper .
some other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
the meet was also attend by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produc by the group `` tell conced '' there is a lack of `` hard evid for the harm of most product on most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or limit are discuss in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe 's claim that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett are act as a rout into smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had been respond to befor .
he said : `` e-cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one in two lifelong smoker die from their addict .
all of the evid suggest that the health risk pose by e-cigarett are small by comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what it doe not show , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die of a smoking-rel ill and smoke cost the nhs £2bn a year .
by spell out clear the current evid - that while e-cigarett are not risk-fre , they carri onli a fraction of the harm caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation remit .
bbc should give up eastend , say former channel 4 chief

if you keep the licenc fee , which i 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduc it output at least to programm that other are n't make and commiss .
they broadcast the voic in a prime slot becaus they want to gain as broad a support as possibl for it futur .
the idea that no one els would show that is a joke , it 's ludicr , it 's obvious nonsens .
johnson said : `` i do n't see whi a regress tax should fund programm that could be fund without subsidi .
the voic is one , eastend is anoth , admit made in-hous .
frank other channel would give their right arm for it .
i struggl to see how it 's public servic broadcast .
i do n't think that would diminish the bbc at all .
johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the bbc was guilti of chase rate `` becaus of the ambit of peopl who work there , and becaus they believ that is the best way to secur long-term support . ''
his comment about the bbc 's most popular show echo those of former sky execut toni ball , who use his mactaggart lectur in edinburgh in 2003 to propos that the bbc sell off show such as eastend .
johnson said the bbc 's more nich public servic programm `` go on to bbc4 where quit often you ca n't measur the audienc but they fulfil their remit and they can argu when they go on their sanctimoni mission about justifi £4bn in licenc fee incom , `` well of cours , we do all these obscur programm that no one watch . ''
they put them on a slot where no one was ever go to watch them .
on the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i challeng you to find a more regress system in term of who get the best valu from it .
of cours you all think , we all think , £150 a year is great valu , but for peopl for whom £150 is a lot of money i wonder if they do becaus they do n't consum a lot of the bbc .
former sky and channel 5 execut david elstein , who also gave evid to the committe on tuesday , said the bbc should revis it reithian mission to `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he said littl of the bbc 's output was now formal classifi as educ - he said it was 1 % of it tv output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public servic broadcast in australia and canada and chang it to `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
on the issu of partnership , elstein said the bbc should do more in area such as the prom , of which he said onli a hand were shown on tv , and enter into allianc with commerci broadcast to make them all avail to watch onlin .

relat : do n't even think about start univers in a relationship
introvert get a raw deal at univers .
your room should be a retreat , yet mani hall form an inter-room-strol cultur that 's friend , social and conduc to lifelong friendship .
that can be hell for someon who 's tri to recharg .
noth in the cultur allow you to say , `` i like you and i want our friendship to continu , but i need you to go away so i can get back the energi i ve expend on interact with you . ''
tri to sens when a fellow student is exhaust from socialis - and mayb text instead of knock .
speak of knock : do it .

media research : sipilä is take a big risk
accord to sipilä , vari channel are need in communic , and the prime minist televis and radio speech are one channel among other .
this kind of a channel for direct speech will be need in the futur , too .
this will not be the last time , sipilä told the report in the parliament .
sipilä did not yet want to estim how recurr these premier speech broadcast through televis and radio are go to be .
accord to sipilä , the speech will not necessarili alway be broadcast from yle channel .
if there are other channel avail , we will see then .
tonight we are use this channel , sipilä said .
accord to sipilä , situat of the finnish economi is so dire that it requir to hold a broadcast speech to the citizen .
this whole complex of issu current in question is quit intric and call for a longer reason .
that is whi we chose this channel , explain sipilä .
the speech will be broadcast between 9.05 and 9.20 pm both via tv1 and radio suomi .
it is also avail in yle areena .
sipilä is take a big risk
media research hope that sipilä televis speech is not a symptom of the govern more general turn inward .
is the goal to take the right to defin public discuss more tight in their own hand and to turn down the frame of question in the public discuss ? anu koivunen , a professor in the univers of stockholm contempl .
this remind me of the foreign minist ( timo ) soini 's recent comment about how he will not follow the media agenda , nor will he let it defin himself .
in the name of democrat discuss and public i hope that these matter are not relat .
koivunen understand that the commerci media is indign about sipilä announc .
it would be odd , if the media would not react .
in a democraci , the polit decis maker communic style are not someth just to be announc .
it is the job of media repres by definit to strive not to take politician agenda as given .
accord to koivunen , a televis speech is a big risk for sipilä .
sipilä should introduc someth new and special in his speech , in order to fulfil the except high expect set for the speech .
are we go to get more of that what we have alreadi heard ?
or is he abl to adopt a differ tone , differ manner or differ word , or to say someth new ?
koivunen say that if all there will be is just same old , we have to wonder the motiv behind this grand gestur and whi yle alloc except time for it ?
this is a risk for yle , as well , in the sens that if this turn out to be not a special situat but just a routin speech among other .
the danger is that yle is label as a medium for politician or the parliament or the govern , which would most definit not be in line with yle 's interest or general polici .
a smart move from sipilä
in sipilä 's forthcom speech import will also be what the prime minist leav unsaid , emphasis the media research .
research coordin of univers of jyväskylä , heikki kuutti , say that one should pay special attent to what sipilä discuss and what he will not .
accord to kuutti , a televis speech is a smart move from sipilä , sinc this way he is abl to highlight his own view without discord note .
this way the messag has a larg audienc without ani journalist filter , unlik in a press confer , where journalist are abl to ask critic question .
sipilä overrid the media and address the peopl direct .
the danger is that media interpret part of the speech in a wrong way , sinc there is no possibl to ask further question .
accord to kuutti it is vital how sipilä present himself in the televis - is he sweat , are his hand shake .
he compar sipilä to a father figur , who is now tell the peopl what to they need to do .
if sipilä can put his point well , it can work .
the situat is differ from one where the govern would be inform the public , sinc this is more like one human be speak to anoth .
this is what ( the presid of the unit state barack ) obama and associ do regular .
quit except
parliamentari research erkka railo think the prime minist speech to the citizen is quit except .
accord to him , it is someth that has not taken place in decad - that the prime minist direct address the peopl .
except time requir except measur , railo say .
the research believ that by act this way , the prime minist want to make finn sympathet to the tighten that will come .
employe associ will organis a demonstr on friday and strike against the govern action .
the left allianc leader paavo arhinmäki said via twitter that sipilä could make his speech about the situat of the nation also in the parliament as a prime minist announc , which would allow for discuss .

point of view : a lousi play underway in ässät
sport director toivola script a sequel unsuit for head coach rautakallio , write santtu silvennoinen from tamper .
it is a classic .
in 1976 , sylvest stallon wrote a script to rocki , in which he star himself .
sensate the underdog stood up to heavyweight world champion , apollo creed .
even though he lost the titl match , rocki evok great sympathi .
thirti year after rocki 's premier , mika toivola script a restless cinderella stori to pori .
the nameless and wooden-hand bunch of spade surpris everyon by advanc to the season final in 2006 .
the team was full of rocky-lik nameless but tenaci underdog .
valkoinen intiaani , porin matti and pele peltonen were some of the name .
for the playoff , the player dy their hair red and cut it to a mohawk hairdo .
toivola turn blond .
an excel tv comment jp jalo name the coach neumann .
ässät won silver .
toivola was one of the hero .
the scriptwrit toivola believ that this season 's new work will function the same way as ten year ago .
work as a sport director for ässät , he has built the spade deck on a foundat of bd boi .
semir ben-amor and josh gratton have thrash bloke in the rink like rocki thrash pig carcass in a slaughterhous .
masi marjamäki , mikko viitanen , juha kiilholma and matti kuparinen all have their merit outsid puck handl .
toivola has forgotten that in rocki vi , main part is play by pekka rautakallio .
karri kivi has christen rautakallio sean conneri .
in toivola script of rocki , rautakallio is as clumsi a protagonist as conneri would have been in the origin work of 1976 .
there is noth rocki in rautakallio besid his nicknam .
rautakallio game philosophi doe not includ rush or minor clamour .
he valu hard play , but play hard is differ than play dirti .
last season , garret stafford from ässät check jere karjalainen from tappara to the head .
he got 2+10 minut from the refere , but rautakallio remov him from the play .
he did not merit one minut !
onli those that deserv it are allow to play .
i do not approv that kind of play , and it is not part of team ässät hockey , snarl rautakallio annoy after the game for satakunnan kansa .
the ässät team for the season is weird construct .
there are junior , veteran , polic and those who rush into thing .
there are practic no key player in their prime .
it is no wonder then that the head coach has complain about the lack of skill .
how much have you been abl to affect the player select , pekka rautakallio ?
the event of the last season affect the select and , unfortun , the situat at the player market was quit limit , rautakallio answ diplomat .
simmer beneath the surfac .
rautakallio , a 1953 model , is , as far as is known , interest in transfer to toivola 's post as a sport director .
both the men contract end this spring .
the team 's balanc in three leagu match has been the same number of defeat , with a goal differ of 1-6 .
toivola should have opt out of write the script for the sequel .

psychologist advis : this is how to tell children about refuge
mani parent has had to wonder about how to tell a child about the situat of the refuge come to europ .
or should they tell anyth about it ?
you do not have to forc the discuss , advis member of the finnish red cross crisi group , psychologist ferdinand garoff .
you should protect smaller children and not let them for exampl watch the news alon .
small children are not alway abl to understand what they see , and that can remain whirl in their mind , caus anxieti , he say .
if a child has seen an imag of refuge in the televis or heard about it elsewher , you should discuss the matter .
you should start the discuss from the child point of view and listen close what she or he ask .
fear of a child can be surpris .
they are necessari not the same a parent think the child is fear .
you should not scare the child for no reason , even though you yourself are anxious or even scare .
a smaller child close follow parent behaviour .
if parent stay calm dure the discuss , also the child feel safe .
bigger children most like hear discuss about refuge in school , with friend or onlin .
if the child is think about the matter , the parent should discuss it with the child .
the fact is that not all the peopl in the world are well-off .
the parent can , togeth with the children , think how our famili feel about this .
do we think the world is eventu a safe or an unsaf place .
the parent may also have differ parent view - some may want to protect their children from anxieti as well as they can .
on the other hand : if the famili discuss also the difficult issu , the child is given a model about how to deal with difficulti in life .
this can come in handi later .

the unit state fed will next attempt to tighten the monetari polici
the next recess in the unit state will begin in it quickest in less than a year , but more like within three year after the countri central bank fed will begin to rais it interest after a long period .
and as for the declin in the financi market , it will begin befor the next recess .
fed has hint at begin the rate hike possibl alreadi this week and by the end of the year at the latest .
that mean the next recess can be here as soon as by next autumn and the financi market rate crash befor tat .
or at least that will happen , if the largest economi in the world and the financi market function in the same way as befor - and if they react to fed financi limit the same way as befor .
these are the conclus the london market research strategist of german deutsch bank jim reid , nick burn and seb parker came to in their studi of long-term market and economi cycl .
the bank distribut the studi report of over 60-page , long-term asset return studi , to their intern major custom last week .
the strategist who creat the studi and the report do not tri to make anyon believ that they know exact when the fed will begin to rais it interest or what happen after that in economi and market .
instead they demonstr how the economi and the market have previous behav dure and after fed interest hike , use cool fact and calcul .
in addit to histor observ they also analys which essenti variabl of economi and the financi market are now on the same or differ level than dure earlier interest hike - and what are the possibl implic .
it is evid that both the economi and the financi market are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever befor sinc the 1950s .
perhap a less than a year to a recess
the leader decid on fed 's monetari polici and it prevail set have dure last summer and earli autumn hint that the time might be ripe to rais the rate .
the first rate hike in over nine year can come alreadi this week .
the matter is settl dure wednesday and thursday , as the fed board 's so call open market committe conven for it two-day meet to decid on the matter .
the previous time fed rais it so call fed fund key interest rate was in june 2006 .
that mark the end of two year of seri of relat regular but minor 0.25 percentag point rate hike that the fed use to rais it interest from 1.25 to 5.25 percent .
the symptom of the financi market began in 2007 with difficulti in the most high-risk hous financ , and a year later the financi crisi widen to a global doomsday nightmar .
the great recess arriv in 2009 .
the last time serious advers of financi market and real economi began slower than what has been typic after earlier fed interest hike .
in proport , the advers were harder and harsher than sinc the 1930s depress .
the deutsch strategist have screen the upturn and downfal of the greatest economi in the world as well as the chang in the financi market sinc 1950 , for some part even from the begin of the 19th centuri onward .
they report fed 's rate hike and their econom and financi impact sinc the 1950s .
the recess has begun the quickest in less than a year after the first rate hike , most of the time in less than three year , and on averag in less than three and a half year .
the increas in price in the financi market has end within a year or two after fed interest hike have begun .
fed has altern between rise and reduc their key interest rate sinc the begin of the 1950s in dozen cycl of differ length .
each time has , for some part , vari from other , and there are relat littl occas in the examin , so it is hard possibl to reach ani certain conclus about the impact of the next rate hike .
the strategist remind us that this time mani thing are differ .
and not just better .
interest have been too low for too long
the pivot factor contribut to , not to mention the culprit for the financi crisi can not necessarili be unquestion discov even with decad of research .
but there are three circumst lead to the crisi and increas it destruct power that are clear somewhat beyond doubt :
1 ) fed , european central bank ecb and other largest central bank of the world held their key interest rate on a too low a level for too long a time in the 2000s .
they were patch the mark left by the techno bubbl and at the same time stoke up the next .
2 ) the size of a debt of differ part of financi and real economi , accumul over decad and alreadi too larg , grew even larger becaus of the over lax monetari polici of the central bank .
the so far largest debt bubbl in the econom histori was creat .
3 ) the mad cheap debt fund , pack especi to financi economi almost without restraint , inflat the largest rate bubbl in the so far econom histori for most of the sector of financi market , from share to real estat , bond and commod .
there will probabl be no sever argument either about the fact that the financi market that have increas to height due to more and more complic debt leverag were in an unusu danger and unstabl state the last time fed and other central bank increas the rate .
neither the financi structur set up with debt leverag nor evalu bubbl did last but a certain time after the rate hike had begun and the cost of debt fund had start to rise .
the risk were materialis as a financi crisi , and a great recess follow .
a bigger bubbl and more debt
the deutsch bank strategist will not guess what happen next , but they give us food for thought by mention for instanc the follow fact :
1 ) fed and other larg central bank have now held their monetari polici set even lighter and even longer than befor the financi crisi .
if the interest rate were too low for a long time befor the crisi , they now have been even lower for even longer .
2 ) incur of a debt has not , for a long time , been as mad cheap as it was ten year ago , but debt money is now liter cheaper than free at it cheapest .
that way the debt load of financi and real economi has not lighten , but the differ part of economi are churn under a consider heavier debt load than befor the financi crisi , or for that matter , ever befor .
3 ) the liquid from the central bank that has start off cheaper and more fast-flow than befor has most stay at the financi market and has drag the key type of secur and properti to their highest peak sinc befor the financi crisi or ever .
and the strategist are kill the mood not onli with the warn sign of financi market , but also by note that not even the unit state economi has recov yet from the financi crisi and the heaviest recess in decad like it earlier has .
the euro area has recov bare at all .
in other word , the real economi is unusu weak , but respect the pressur and risk of the financi market are clear larger than befor the financi crisi , as fed will next start to cut off their money .
mayb the outlook of albert edward , a strategist from a french bank societ general , is not as weird as it may seem at a first glanc .
for quit some time now , he has coach the intern investor custom as to the fed next revers :
first they rais the interest rate , then the financi bubbl burst - and soon it is time for fed to hasten to put out the financi fire with even bigger qe money hose .
comput and printer manufactur hewlett-packard ( hp ) plan to shed up to 33,000 job .

more than three year ago the west ignor russian offer to have syrian presid bashar al-assad to give up power , say presid martti ahtisaari for the guardian .
accord to ahtisaari , the russian ambassador for the un laid out a plan , which includ have al-assad eleg cede power after some time .
the western countri did not grasp the propos , though , sinc they thought al-assad would fall anyway in a few week .
ahtisaari held talk about the syrian crisi with five perman member of the un secur council in 2012 .
he said that in a privat convers , the russian ambassador , vitali churkin , laid out a three-point plan : we should not give arm to the opposit , we should get dialogu go between the opposit and al-assad straight away , and we should find an eleg way for al-assad to step asid .

britain former director of the middl east depart of the foreign offic , sir john jenkin , is hesit about ahtisaari claim , sinc in his experi , russia was at no stage prepar to discuss al-assad fate .
offici russia has support al-assad dure the whole war .
the weakest point in ahtisaari claim is that churkin would have been speak with moscow author .
i think if he had told me what churkin had said , i would have repli i want to hear it from presid vladimir putin too befor i could take it serious .
accord to jenkin , he would have even then suspect that it was a putin trick to keep an al-assad support in power .

at their most anticip meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week seat around a 27-foot honduran mahogani tabl decid if it 's time to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
loom over them at one end of the central bank 's ornat , two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to put the nation 's econom interest abov all other .
the central bank has a dual charg from congress : maxim u.s. employ and keep price here stabl .
but sinc the great recess , fed leader have acknowledg that there 's an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and that third mandat could be the x-factor in a too-close-to-predict decis , to be announc thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to start be wean from the unpreced stimulus provid by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
even though most data show the economi grow solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market could make already-cauti fed offici skittish about ad to the volatil by rais their benchmark feder fund rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious the labor market and inflat is go to be first and foremost the most import thing they watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais the rate , the increas uncertainti surround the global marketplac is enough to provid them with justif to wait further , '' she said .
there 's no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is caus financi market jitter .
about half of economist survey recent by bloomberg predict a rate increas this week .
financi market , howev , are expect the fed to hold off , with a key indic show onli about a 30 % chanc of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed rais the rate , unless policymak were to soften the blow by promis that anoth increas would be a way off .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228.89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that fed policymak will hold the rate steadi this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed hike rate at this point in time , '' he said .
if fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to great length in their polici statement to hold financi market ' hand so they do n't panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seem on track to rais the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would valid the strength of the u.s. recoveri .
yellen had said through the spring and earli summer that she expect a rate increas this year despit complaint from liber that more econom progress was need .
although job creation slow in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate drop to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year and near the level the fed consid to be full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and although inflat continu to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , fed policymak said a key reason was the temporari effect of sharpli lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate , and need them , given the tight of the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world start convuls late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag drop as much as 16 % below it record high in may as investor fear a slow chines economi would drag down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , with the dow now down near 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymak , the market turmoil add to the complex calculus of when to rais the interest rate .
`` absent what happen in financi market and the news about the weak in the chines economi over the past coupl week , they would be tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he predict they ll wait at least a month to get a better handl on the effect .
`` there 's a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the u.s. economi are go to be , and they have almost no data to reli on that post-dat the develop in china , '' olin said .
the health of the global economi is n't one of the fed 's primari concern , so technic it should n't be factor into it decision-mak .
but , in effect , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint by then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed might `` taper '' it monetari expans trigger market convuls around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , fed offici can be expect not onli to monitor the develop elsewher but also to consult with other central banker and expert to get a better read on the global economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of overreact to financi market movement that seem unconnect to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe who has been push for a rate increas , cite decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
a financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over three meet `` despit limit identifi implic for u.s. growth , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici revers those cut .
the fed should put financi stabil concern first onli dure a major crisi , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's rate-set committe .
the latest turmoil doe n't come close to that level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be put in a situat of be scare of a rate hike becaus market got upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv act still has the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that is chang , i do n't think they should get ahead of the curv .

whi i 'm a wit at an execut in oklahoma
later today , bar a late legal intervent , i will watch a man be put to death .
if it happen , and i hope it wo n't , i will sit in a view galleri in the death chamber at oklahoma state penitentiari as richard glossip is execut by lethal inject .
he has ask me to be one of four offici wit to his death .
the invit was first made back in januari , via his best friend , and though i was shock , i agre .
as the day approach , i ve come to dread it .
so whi do it ?
i agre becaus i thought it was a good way of tell the full stori about the death penalti .
it would offer a uniqu perspect .
true , journalist are permit to watch execut in america and becaus there are often more applic than seat avail , a macabr lotteri take place to decid who will be chosen .
oklahoma has reduc the number of media seat from 12 to five .
whoever is pick will watch it dispassion .
i can not do that .
i will be sit alongsid richard glossip 's closest friend , and i have develop my own relationship with him through month of phone call , and one visit last two-and-a-half hour .
i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison author say i can not be both a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be allow a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to tri to rememb all the detail .
one oklahoma journalist accus me on twitter of compromis my imparti .
here 's the lesson .
tell the inmat 's stori the way he like it , get access .
i complain to her .
she admit that she `` could have phrase it better , '' but still think i 'm wrong to do what i 'm do .
richard glossip has taken issu with some of the thing i ve said and written .
he doe n't tell me what to write , and i would n't do it even if he did .
i ve told him he can remov me from his list of wit at ani time .
but he want an intern report to be there to write about it .
if he die , he think the public will help the anti-death penalti movement .
kim bellwar , a report from the huffington post , will be alongsid me .
if you want to know more about the case , pleas listen to the seri of podcast i ve made .
i wo n't go over all the detail again here .
i can not say with certainti that richard glossip is innoc .
his action after the murder of barri van trees would make him guilti of be an accessori after the fact .
but i believ there is a strong probabl that he is not guilti of murder .
i certain believ there was not enough evid to justifi a death sentenc .
i believ his execut is wrong .
and it 's from this perspect that i will watch him die .
i can not claim to be truli object .
there will be other report you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man i like die an unnecessari death .

brisban bronco coach wayn bennett made a thin veil refer to the storm after his side 's qualifi final win over north queensland cowboy on saturday night when he call that game a `` showcas '' of the rugbi leagu and said the two queensland were n't `` too big '' into wrestl .
bellami defend his side 's tackl and said they just focus on their `` contact '' when tackl .
bellami ad he took confid from have two lead coach criticis his side as it meant they were concern about the storm beat them .
`` that keep come up - i did n't hear trent robinson bring up wrestl when they beat us 24-2 , '' bellami said on wednesday .
i can guarante we have n't chang noth all year with our defens system or techniqu , it 's just that the last six week we have made a real emphasi with our contact in tackl and that has been the turn around for us .
trent has been there three year and he obvious has a great side to coach so he is probabl not use to lose so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it 's funni how this alway come up at this time of year .
bellami challeng bennett 's idea of `` excit footbal '' remind his mentor that bennett 's st george-illawarra dragon won the premiership in 2010 by play `` bore '' footbal .
wayn is talk about excit footi .
he made a point of compar his game on saturday night with our one on friday night and how excit their game was , '' bellami said .
i rememb in 2010 st georg was criticis a lot for be a bore team and wayn said he did n't give a rat 's ars .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as excit footi , especi his young halv with their speed .
that 's the footi you would want to play when you have those sort of player .
he made that point in 2010 , now he want everyon to play his style of footi - not everi team has two halv like anthoni milford and ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it build more confid becaus they are say these thing becaus they are a littl bit concern about play us .
six week ago they probabl were n't think of us when they get to the big game .
bellami also point out the storm and rooster game was a higher score contest than the bronco and cowboy game .
the bronco game was probabl a good game , i have n't watch it yet but what was the score ? 16-12 ?
our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tri in our game but is that excit footi ?
or is it make break and not score tri that is excit ?
to me it 's agenda .
if they are mention us it mean that at some stage we might meet them there .
the storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either north queensland cowboy or cronulla shark in next saturday night 's preliminari final at aami park with ticket on sale from next tuesday morn .
