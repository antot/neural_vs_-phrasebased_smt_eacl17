8 poll number that show donald trump is for real
some have tri to label him a flip-flopp .
other have dismiss him as a joke .
and some are hold out for an implos .
but no matter how some republican are tri to drag donald trump down from atop the poll , it has n't work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 nation poll have shown donald trump 's lead at doubl digit , and some are start to ask serious what it mean for the real estat mogul 's nomin chanc .
of cours , it 's still earli in the elect cycl .
none of this is to say that trump is like to win the republican nomin .
pundit point out that at this time in 2011 , rick perri 's lead was give way to a rise herman cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomin process .
and there are mani reason he would struggl in a general elect .
but outsid group like jeb bush 's super pac and the econom conserv group club for growth are recogn trump 's stay power and begin to unload their dollar to toppl him .
here are some recent poll number that suggest that the real estat mogul is n't just a pass phase :
trump 's favor rate have turn 180 degre .
right befor donald trump announc his candidaci in mid-jun , a monmouth univers poll show onli two in 10 republican had a posit view of the real estat mogul .
by mid-juli , it was 40 percent .
in earli august , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 republican have a favor view of donald trump .
rough three in 10 say they have a negat view .
and these number hold up in earli state .
a quinnipiac poll in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republican there had a favor view of trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as the nomine .
in a cnn/orc poll last week , 67 percent of republican said they would be either `` enthusiast '' or `` satisfi '' if trump were the nomine .
onli two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nomine .
onli ben carson generat rough the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiast '' vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with onli 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of republican voter say they would be `` dissatisfi '' or `` upset '' if establish favorit jeb bush becom the nomine .
a major of republican do n't see trump 's tempera as a problem .
while donald trump has been wide critic for his bombast and insult , 52 percent of lean republican voter nationwid think that the real estat mogul has the right tempera to be presid , accord to monday 's abc news/washington post poll .
the same number hold in the first-in-the-n caucus state of iowa , where the same 52 percent of republican think he has the person to be command in chief , accord to quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doe n't have the person to serv effect , and almost six in 10 independ say his tempera doe not belong in the white hous , accord to abc/post .
republican voter are get use to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hat , republican voter think trump is for real .
when ask who is most like to win the gop nomin , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , accord to a cnn/orc poll out last week .
that 's a chang from when four in 10 place their money on jeb bush in late juli .
full disclosur : gop voter have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycl , four in 10 republican pick rick perri to win the nomin , vs. onli 28 percent for eventu nomine mitt romney .
still , it show that a plural of gop voter see trump 's campaign as plausibl .
even if republican ralli around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some pundit point out that the splinter field is like contribut to trump 's lead , while anti-trump support is be spread diffus among more than a dozen other candid .
but a monmouth univers poll in earli septemb show that , in a hypothet head-to-head matchup between trump and most other republican candid , trump almost alway garner major support .
he lead car fiorina by 13 point , marco rubio by 14 point , walker by 15 point , jeb bush by 19 point , and , final , rand paul , john kasich and chris christi by 33 point each .
he 's in a dead heat with ted cruz .
the onli candid who beat him ?
ben carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 point in a hypothet head-to-head .
a bare major of donald trump 's support say they ve made up their mind .
a new cbs/nyt poll out on tuesday show that just more than half of voter who support trump say they have lock in their vote .
obvious , a lot can happen to chang that , and no one can realli say they would never chang their mind .
46 percent said they are leav the door open to switch candid .
still , trump 's strongest competit at the moment is from fellow outsid neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who say they have made up their mind are twice as like to go for trump .
six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr .
even sinc donald trump call immigr from mexico `` rapist '' in his campaign announc speech two month ago , immigr has been front and center in the 2016 convers .
some are worri that trump 's bombast will drive crucial hispan voter away from the republican parti and damag rebrand effort .
but accord to monday 's new abc/post poll , six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr issu .
so as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , it seem donald trump will remain too .
frustrat with govern is climb to new high .
donald trump and ben carson now account for rough half of the support from republican voter , larg due to their outsid status .
six in 10 republican in monday 's new abc/post poll say they want a polit outsid over someon with govern experi .
and they are angri at washington , too .
a des moin register/bloomberg poll in iowa from two week ago show that three in four iowa republican are frustrat with republican in congress , with 54 percent `` unsatisfi '' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . ''

here 's what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will climb and the economi will slip into a recess .
this we know .
what we do n't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economi specif , histori offer littl guid about time .
a recess has come as quick as 11 month after the first rate hike and as long as 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , a determin in how the economi and financi asset respond .
that 's whi offici at the u.s. central bank have stress so vigor that investor should not be focus on when it start rais rate but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are , inde , multipl variabl at play .
in the end , howev , market particip may find that all the rate-hik fuss may have been overdon .
`` the first hike from the fed sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as signal the end of the era of cheap money , ' `` julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom , said in a note to client .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rate to more normal but still low level to be the seismic shock that mani seem to fear .
that 's not to say there wo n't be effect , howev .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi could react , base on histor trend :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip of rate hike can make thing volatil for a while .
onc the hike hit , though , the impact is not as dramat .
`` it doe seem there is a trend for equiti return to stall 12-24 month after the first hike , which again perhap reflect the lag in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi of what happen after the fed hike .
more specif , the market over the past 35 year or so is most often up sharpli - about 14 percent - head into the rate hike , fair flat in the 250 day after ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal onc 500 day have pass , with averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi bob doll , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , post on barron 's .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to get more pronounc later in the rate-hik cycl and return begin to diminish .
recess are a fact of econom life , but rate hike often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is face some condit that did not exist befor and could hasten a recess .
most notabl , gross domest product will be near it lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , in the 118 rate hike sinc 1950 , onli twice has nomin year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter track at just 1.5 percent , accord to the atlanta fed .
hike rate into such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and set up the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip have been brace for a fed hike all year , with all eye turn toward this week 's feder open market committe meet , which end thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv a hike at this meet , futur trade indic just a 25 percent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all hike cycl to date have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp eclips prerecess peak veri quick post the recoveri commenc , '' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest the fed has wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record had been 35 month , and this is 74 month and count .
fix incom also has been volatil as the market anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equiti experi .
the princip differ is that the impact happen faster in bond than stock when the fed chang cours in polici .
for bond , it doe seem yield chang direct immedi as the first hike/cut in the cycl arriv .
at the end of the hike cycl bond yield fall immedi , '' deutsch said .
charl schwab strategist believ the hike in rate will caus yield between longer- and shorter-d bond to move closer togeth , flatten the curv .
high-yield bond often perform better in such a climat , though `` we are still cautious about stretch for yield , '' kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab , said in an analysi .
interest , jone think market alreadi have adapt to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread have widen and volatil has increas - all characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad speak , compani that do the major of their busi in the u.s. will win as interest rate rise and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt will fare wors , as a rise dollar make their product more expens in the global market space and their debt more expens the financ .
`` histori show that qualiti ' stock tend to outperform dure the three month follow an initi rate hike , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report for client .
firm with strong balanc sheet outpac weak balanc sheet compani follow each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hike , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit as well as low volatil stock also outperform their lower qualiti counterpart , by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) , respect .
debt will becom a big issu .
compani with a high percentag of float rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outsid pure stock play , consum stand to benefit as well through the rise dollar .
saver could see gain as well through higher yield at the , though expert differ on how quick that will take hold .

`` open up ! '' chant hundr of refuge at the horgo checkpoint on the serbian-hungarian border .
sinc tuesday , budapest has close the border to immigr .
asylum seeker are alreadi begin to test out other possibl rout into the eu .
one of them is bypass the close border with serbia through romania .
anoth is through croatia and slovenia into austria .
accord to some report , the buse that transport refuge from serbia into hungari are now be sent to the town of šid on the croatian border .
the driver have receiv order from the author to carri on without stop .
serbian minist of intern affair nebojša stefanović pledg that his countri was do everyth in it power to help the refuge , but that it had limit resourc :
our job entail protect serbia to the greatest extent possibl .
on the other hand , we should also help these peopl , make sure that they are treat human .
but this has alreadi becom a europe-wid problem .
it will not be easi to solv ; no countri in europ can deal with it on it own , especi such a small countri as serbia .
belgrad is ask budapest to open it border to the refuge who do n't want to stay in serbia .
but hungarian prime minist viktor orban is uncompromis :
if someon is claim to be a refuge , they ought to fill-out the necessari document for this in serbia .
and if they do n't do this , then they will not be permit to enter our countri , becaus it is complet safe in serbia .
hungari has alreadi erect a 175-kilometr fenc along the border with serbia .
but orban is not content to stop there : he plan on erect a similar fenc on the border with romania .
bucharest has alreadi declar that this is incompat with european principl .
evangelo meimaraki : `` europ want to help us '' .
for a number of year , evangelo meimaraki was part of the centre-right govern , which , accord to those on the left , led the countri into a financi crisi .
now , have becom the interim leader of the new democraci parti , he is mount a challeng to tsipra .
a few day befor the elect , he met with a journalist from euronew .
euronew : mr. meimaraki , welcom to euronew !
evangelo meimaraki : thank you for the invit .
euronew : nine month ago , your parti suffer a crush defeat , lose to the syriza coalit , but now , judg from the poll , new democraci has match it in term of popular .
what has chang sinc that time ?
evangelo meimaraki : greec has chang and we have too .
mr. tsipra lie a lot in januari of last year .
nine month ago , greec had a budget surplus and prospect for econom growth .
now , the countri onc again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemploy .
investor have fled becaus mr. tsipra chase them away .
over the past nine month , greek have had the opportun to assess the state the countri was in in januari and the fals promis of mr. tsipra .
now , they can easili compar these promis to what has actual transpir .
daili life has becom notic wors compar to in januari , when the situat was get better ; moreov , this concern the major of greek citizen .
euronew : but you say that if you win the elect you will seek allianc with other parti , includ syriza .
evangelo meimaraki : the fact is that greec , as we have come to understand in recent year , can not move forward without understand and cooper .
it is no coincid that in all the other countri where rescu programm were in effect or continu to oper , polit forc and all the rule parti got togeth in order to implement the programm that they had reach a consensus on , while , at the same time , never abandon their polit or ideolog independ .
that 's whi i firm believ that , at this stage , onli the cooper of polit forc and institut will enabl the countri to move forward .
euronew : your parti vote in favour of the agreement between mr. tsipra and the countri 's creditor .
if , on monday , you becom the new prime minist , will you compli with this agreement , or will you chang it , at least in part ?
evangelo meimaraki : actual , we vote for greec to move along the european path , becaus we understand all too well the devast consequ that would have follow the countri 's withdraw from the eu .
right now , europ is help us by provid subsidi to our farmer for their product ; we have cohes fund , and a juncker packag , and assist in the bank sector .
all of this would have been lost if there was no agreement with europ .
but the current auster measur are the result of how mr. tsipra conduct negoti .
i know that europ doe n't want to destroy us .
europ want to help us .
therefor , if europ see that the new greek govern , over the cours of their first year in power , want to restor order , act ration , and make it understood that the countri has the strong polit will to implement the rescu programm , then i am confid that all of the assum commit , which can not be implement due to the fact that they are lead to a recess , could onc again becom a subject of negoti , but onli after a certain amount of time has pass .
it would be a mistak to assum that we could alreadi go back to the negoti tabl with our creditor in the first year of the new agreement , sinc they expect a full implement of the deal .
if we want to regain their trust , we need to continu with privatis , reform , and the structur chang that were agre on , while continu to benefit from eu fund and greater invest opportun , which we need to go ahead with to ensur better understand and cooper with europ .
unfortun , dure the negoti , the tsipra govern did n't present ani compel argument about mani key polit issu , which we found out about while discuss these issu with our european colleagu .
i can give you an exampl associ with farmer ' incom .
we explain to our european partner that we were n't talk about a fix month incom , and , as such , it could n't be fulli tax in advanc .
we were told that tsipra ' minist never spoke about this .
that is to say , the greek minist were not prepar and were poor inform , and , as a result , they conduct negoti ineffect and conclud a bad agreement .
euronew : if you win the elect , you will soon be at the same tabl as mr. juncker , mr. holland , ms. merkel , and other european leader .
will what you say to them differ in ani way from what your predecessor , anthoni samara , said to them ?
evangelo meimaraki : first of all , i will explain to them that , up until the end of 2014 , we tri our best to fulfil the 2012 agreement , while avoid the most contenti issu contain within it .
we push forward with reform .
of cours , we lack the necessari determin and speed , but we were oper under extraordinari circumst .
the market crash , and there were no prospect buyer in sight readi to pay the price the greek govern consid accept .
back then , i was the parliamentari speaker and i succeed in balanc the view of the three parliamentari group , which , at that time , constitut a parliamentari major .
in spite of their signific ideolog disagr on key bill , we had a work parliament , and this was in the midst of populist and extremist , as well as mass demonstr happen outsid .
and we manag to guid the countri to a state of normalci , which would have continu to get better if the process had not been interrupt by earli general elect that were the consequ of the decemb presidenti elect .
euronew : over the past week , a massiv flow of refuge has been move across greek territori .
what do you think about this situat , and about the reaction of the european countri into which these peopl are seek to enter ?
evangelo meimaraki : the refuge crisi is a tick time bomb that we will be forc to deal with after our elect victori .
the reason for this is that the syriza govern did n't deal with this situat in the way that it should have .
in such matter , it pay to be proactiv , becaus if the problem catch up with you , then you are onli left with emerg measur .
and we now find ourselv in this situat .
even the interim govern that replac syriza has done more in just seven day than mr. tsipra did in seven month .
i am confid that the action of the interim govern , which has been provid with valuabl assist from the presid of the republ , who has call for an eu summit to be held , will enabl us to find a solut .
we need to see how mani refuge could leav the countri , and take note : refuge , not illeg immigr .
these are victim of the war in syria : victim of certain extrem event that have happen to them .
this issu has a deepli humanitarian aspect to it , and we will support the posit that european politician should take in this new situat .
an appropri decis should be made at the eu summit and it should also involv the unit nation .
we need to have better coordin action , more effect border control , and refuge process centr .
we also need to effect use the econom assist we receiv from the eu in order to be in a posit to deal with this urgent problem .
euronew : mister meimaraki , thank you for the interview .
evangelo meimaraki : thank you .

sure david cameron know the lorax better than this ?
it 's one thing ani parent soon learn : when your child love a book , it wo n't be long befor you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seem , you are david cameron .
ask by a provid of holiday childcar scheme to name his favourit kid ' book , the prime minist opt for the lorax , the 1971 environment fabl by dr seuss .
it was a difficult choic , cameron write in a messag publish on the websit of the supercamp compani , continu : `` funni , move , creativ and with a power messag , it 's one i enjoy read to my children becaus there alway seem to be an imag or a messag that we have previous miss . ''
all veri well , except that the subsequ paragraph in which cameron suppos describ the plot of the book instead give a précis of the 2012 film version , which ad new charact and detail to pad out the fair brief origin text .
`` set in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where all natur has gone and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey , by fulfil her wish to see a real tree , '' it read , chronicl a love interest unknown to dr seuss , real name theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
if that was n't suspici enough , cameron 's submit text read in part like a plot summari of the lorax film provid on the internet movi databas websit , which begin : `` in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where everyth is artifici and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey . ''
given he is an avow hands-on parent , it seem unlik cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnam boy hear how the local environ was devast by the avarici , tree-chop , thneed-knit once-l , despit the protest of the eponym lorax , a squat , moustachio creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like , such a relat lowli pr task would have been outsourc to an aid , seem one who has never read the lorax 20 time in a row to a child .
a down street spokeswoman said the text was believ to have come from cameron 's constitu offic .
supercamp confirm that the text was provid from cameron 's staff , but had no further immedi comment .
adam lyth was clear at risk of england omiss but it 's still tough
take on pakistan in the unit arab emir is a tough assign but after see the squad england have select for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat suffer last time doe not look on the card for me .
i would n't rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago but there are good player of spin in that bat lineup and the collect mindset is strong ; they will not carri scar from 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali is develop as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop from england test squad and replac by alex hale
the decis to omit adam lyth is obvious a tough one for me to analys as his head coach at yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are judg on output .
there were no question mark over joe root , for exampl , lead up to the announc becaus - and i have said this befor - player are their own best selector .
a coupl of half-centuri and lyth might have seen his run extend but he was in control of his own destini .
hope if he punch out more run for yorkshir anoth opportun will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud even when he was not perform as well as he can and that doe not surpris me ; he is a team man abov all els .
the question of how long a test batsman get to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven cap - like sam robson befor him - while nick compton got nine .
onli compton got the chanc home and away .
the onli gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wast opportun is in the past now .
alex hale come in and he is a batsman i rate high .
he is an x-factor cricket , which we at yorkshir saw earli this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch that was do a bit .
he must at least be afford the same opportun as those befor him but this will of cours depend on the make-up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen open the bat alongsid cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keep four quick , has been float and it is not someth i am against .
i do n't see whi a strokemak can not bat there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he is one hell of a cricket .
moeen may not have done the job for his counti , worcestershir , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much differ .
my old team-mat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop befor step up to open in 2001 .
he peel off three centuri immedi and did not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limit deal with him , he has struck me as veri impress young man .
peopl may look at his raw stat - averag 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a heap of spinner put their hand up and selector have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a coupl of shrewd addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the game 's loveliest bloke , who will bring a wealth of experi have done it in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood come in for the white-bal leg of the tour and will bring both energi and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i alway felt he was born to be involv in intern cricket , be it play or coach , and like mahela has nous that can be tap .
sometim new voic in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with what has been said befor , can freshen up a side .
colli 's durham team-mat ben stoke is rest for the one-day , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issu with this .
while not everyon will agre , the coach and selector do not set the schedul .
and you have to rememb , like player , their job are depend on result .
such decis are never taken light .
brexit camp might win the day if economi is in doldrum by 2017
david cameron 's half-bak renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu get deeper into troubl with everi day that pass , even without the elect of genial jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cut up rough over europ on tuesday .
foreign have their corbyn and nigel farag too .
a european diplomat chum explain the other day that , sunk in assort crise as the eu is - not all of their own make - some member state are fed up with britain 's self-absorb agenda of divis concess and disrupt treati chang which they most do n't want .
in brighton for it annual bean , the tuc decid it did n't want them either if they erod social protect .
we could even call it dave and georg 's selfi agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summit or bilater session in foreign capit , take a photo of themselv in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grande , then come home and say they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european pal , who want an outward-look britain insid the eu tent - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that more short-sight minist and offici in some capit have got to the point where they do n't care whether we stay or leav .
angela merkel , germani 's cautious level-head chancellor , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year and want to leav offic befor it goe bad for her , as it did for overstay thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
franc 's françoi holland is face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
he is a fade forc too .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern of the right , spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them break a leg to help the selfi brit , whose energi might be better spent prevent scotland leav the uk - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some such minist may even be plan to make deliber unhelp remark , snp-style , dure the uk 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggest .

for all his foolish ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
they includ the medley of tax-shi rascal , phone-hack foreign and pseudo non-dom who own most of our great newspap .
actual toni blair thought much the same about them , but realis that when you re in a cage with a randi gorilla you have to pass the banana to distract it from have you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairit than blair in oppos cameron 's referendum wheez , sinc blair had conced the principl over the eu 's abort constitut , sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgav him that either .
but nice jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back at westminst on monday - i told him he no longer has time to wast on me - seem to be in danger of re-adopt neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of the 80s , a mistak then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coher strategi to engag with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacat on sunday .

it 's fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europ , allow him to take labour 's support for grant in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel has said .
simon jenkin certain think so .

expert criticis public health england e-cigarett review
claim by a government-fund agenc that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke aros from a meet of 12 peopl , some with link to the tobacco industri , research have said .
expert write in the british medic journal ( bmj ) join the lancet in criticis the evid use by public health england ( phe ) in it report on e-cigarett .
phe publish the `` landmark '' report last month , describ it as a `` comprehens review of the evid . ''
but sever research have question the robust of the data and point to link between some expert and the tobacco industri .
an editori in the lancet medic journal last month attack the `` extraordinarili flimsi foundat '' on which phe base it main conclus .
write in the bmj , two further research have question whether the claim were `` built on rock or sand . ''
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
they said the public would expect phe 's claim that `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' would be base on a detail review of evid and model .
in fact , it come from a singl meet of 12 peopl conven to develop a multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) model to synthesis their opinion on the harm associ with differ nicotine-contain product ; the result of the meet were summaris in a research paper .
mckee and capewel said one sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose chief execut was report to have previous receiv fund from british american tobacco for an independ studi .
he also endors bat 's public health credenti in a sustain report , they said .
one of the 12 peopl at the meet declar fund from an e-cigarett manufactur but not the fund he was report to have receiv previous from the tobacco compani philip morri intern , they ad .
the rational for select the member of the panel is not provid , but they includ sever known e-cigarett champion , some of whom also declar industri fund in the paper .
some other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
the meet was also attend by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produc by the group `` tell conced '' there is a lack of `` hard evid for the harm of most product on most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or limit are discuss in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe 's claim that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett are act as a rout into smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had been respond to befor .
he said : `` e-cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one in two lifelong smoker die from their addict .
all of the evid suggest that the health risk pose by e-cigarett are small by comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what it doe not show , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die of a smoking-rel ill and smoke cost the nhs £2bn a year .
by spell out clear the current evid - that while e-cigarett are not risk-fre , they carri onli a fraction of the harm caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation remit .
bbc should give up eastend , say former channel 4 chief
the former channel 4 chairman luke johnson has said the bbc should stop broadcast programm such as eastend and the voic , say it commerci rival would `` give their right arm '' for hit show such as the albert squar soap .
johnson said the licenc fee should onli be use to make the sort of programm that are not made by other uk broadcast .
he criticis the bbc for put public servic programm like to be watch by a smaller audienc in tough slot against it rival '' biggest rate show , and on channel such as bbc4 .
after the bbc 's director general , toni hall , said the corpor want to do more in partnership with other organis , johnson said he had tri for six year in his time at channel 4 to do a tie-up with the bbc without success .
`` i do struggl with the idea that the bbc commiss and broadcast programm that would clear be shown by unsubsidis rival , '' johnson told the hous of lord communic committe , as part of it inquiri into the futur of the bbc .
if you keep the licenc fee , which i 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduc it output at least to programm that other are n't make and commiss .
they broadcast the voic in a prime slot becaus they want to gain as broad a support as possibl for it futur .
the idea that no one els would show that is a joke , it 's ludicr , it 's obvious nonsens .
johnson said : `` i do n't see whi a regress tax should fund programm that could be fund without subsidi .
the voic is one , eastend is anoth , admit made in-hous .
frank other channel would give their right arm for it .
i struggl to see how it 's public servic broadcast .
i do n't think that would diminish the bbc at all .
johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the bbc was guilti of chase rate `` becaus of the ambit of peopl who work there , and becaus they believ that is the best way to secur long-term support . ''
his comment about the bbc 's most popular show echo those of former sky execut toni ball , who use his mactaggart lectur in edinburgh in 2003 to propos that the bbc sell off show such as eastend .
johnson said the bbc 's more nich public servic programm `` go on to bbc4 where quit often you ca n't measur the audienc but they fulfil their remit and they can argu when they go on their sanctimoni mission about justifi £4bn in licenc fee incom , `` well of cours , we do all these obscur programm that no one watch . ''
they put them on a slot where no one was ever go to watch them .
on the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i challeng you to find a more regress system in term of who get the best valu from it .
of cours you all think , we all think , £150 a year is great valu , but for peopl for whom £150 is a lot of money i wonder if they do becaus they do n't consum a lot of the bbc .
former sky and channel 5 execut david elstein , who also gave evid to the committe on tuesday , said the bbc should revis it reithian mission to `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he said littl of the bbc 's output was now formal classifi as educ - he said it was 1 % of it tv output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public servic broadcast in australia and canada and chang it to `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
on the issu of partnership , elstein said the bbc should do more in area such as the prom , of which he said onli a hand were shown on tv , and enter into allianc with commerci broadcast to make them all avail to watch onlin .
sonogenet ' allow brain cell to be control by sound wave
the video show how the nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls .
scientist have bred worm with genet modifi nervous system that can be control by burst of sound wave .
the tini nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls that are too high-pitch for human to hear .
the puls work by switch on motor neuron cell that are genet modifi to carri membran channel that respond to ultrason wave .
relat : research read and write brain activ with light
research said the worm demonstr the power of a new procedur , dub sonogenet , in which ultrasound can be use to activ a rang of brain , heart and muscl cell from outsid the bodi .
sreekanth chalasani , a research at the salk institut in la jolla , california , told the guardian that the procedur could one day replac deep-brain stimul , an invas procedur that deliv electr puls into peopl 's brain to treat symptom of parkinson 's diseas .
nematod worm do not usual react to ultrasound , but chalasani found that they did when they were surround by a fluid contain microscop bubbl .
the bubbl , he found , amplifi the ultrason wave which then pass insid the worm .
the amplifi ultrasound wave act on structur call trp-4 ion channel , found in the membran of some of the worm '' cell .
the sound wave make these ion channel open up and activ the cell they are attach to , accord to a report in natur communic .
to make ultrasound-control nematod , chalasani genet modifi the worm so that some of their motor neuron carri trp-4 ion channel .
when he appli ultrasound to the modifi creatur , the sound wave were amplifi by the microbubbl and transmit into the worm , where they switch on the modifi motor neuron .
the procedur has some similar with optogenet , a groundbreak tool that allow scientist to switch neuron on and off with puls of light .
but chalasani said that sonogenet could have some advantag over that techniqu .
unlik light , which has to be sent down an optic fibr to the desir locat insid the brain , low frequenc ultrasound wave can pass through tissu unhind , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
`` we believ that , use gene therapi and a therapeut virus , it may be possibl to make target human neuron temporarili suscept to the ultrasound signal in a clinic set for certain neurolog treatment , '' said chalasani .
other applic could focus on muscl cell and insulin-produc cell , he ad .

as grib explain , a bloc could hold 50 or 100 peopl , and if one specialis build is establish in russia , then convict transsexu from ani region could be sent there to serv out their sentenc .
citizen are held in pre-trial detent facil accord to the place where the crime was commit , and , as such , the arriv of transvestit or transgend peopl from differ territori subject dure the investig and court proceed is unrealist ; howev , introduc this practic in a separ coloni , for those who have alreadi been convict is definit possibl , grib believ .
to recap , yesterday , law enforc offic could not decid which pre-trial detent facil - male or femal - to assign to 24-year-old transsexu dmitri kozhukov ( known as alina davi ) , detain for drug possess , and , as a result , the man with a girlish appear was not arrest .
he was sent home on the written condit that he would not leav town .
this news was wide discuss on social network and in the media , sinc , as of yet , there is no procedur in russia for hold transgend peopl in pre-trial detent facil and penal coloni .
russian human right advoc and activist in the lgbt movement ( lgbt - lesbian , gay , bisexu , transgend ) , nikolai alekseev , support the idea of creat special place for transgend peopl to serv out their sentenc , note that , abroad , it is also possibl to place peopl in penal coloni - male or femal - depend on their own prefer .
given the climat in russian prison , this is the correct recommend .
yes , it 's a veri small percentag , but the problem is real , just as is the issu of ensur the safeti of homosexu in prison , say alekseev .
prison should be safe ; therefor , separ bloc could be establish for this sake , as well as for homosexu , especi sinc there are more of them in prison than transgend peopl .
moreov , alekseev doubt that there will be a lot of citizen in russia who will be readi to pass themselv off as transsexu just to get into somewher other than a regular penal coloni .
of cours , a medic examin could be introduc befor place peopl into a penal coloni for transgend peopl ; howev , thing are not alway so straightforward .
for exampl , in the us , one prison , chelsea man , look like a man , but onc alreadi in prison , announc that he want to chang his sex , say alekseev .
a person can feel like they are anyon at all .
howev , as of yet , there are no separ facil for transgend peopl to serv out their sentenc , and i doubt that prison staff will think serious about the safeti of such peopl or fathom the complex of their orient or gender identif .
at the same time , intern expert on issu of reproduct health in the russian feder , bori lordkipanidz , note that the introduct of a new system for assign transsexu crimin to a penal coloni could signific delay the start of the convict serv their sentenc .
a committe is creat : this is a question of sexolog , with psychiatrist conduct long-term examin - this is not just one test - on the basi of which a high precis diagnosi is made .
modern practic in psychiatri make this possibl .
this is whi , befor a sex chang , potenti patient undergo such expert evalu ; they will definit show whether or not a sex chang requir surgeri is a necessari measur , say lordkipanidz .
howev , it is difficult for me to imagin how to introduc this system in relat to convict individu ; after all , on averag , it take an entir month to conduct such an examin .
the doctor , in spite of the fact that he support the general idea of creat separ bloc for transsexu , also doubt that it would be appropri under current econom condit to alloc fund toward the construct of new facil and medic examin : transgend peopl in russia are few and far between .
it 's difficult to come up with a number as there are no offici statist , but if one consid that homosexu account for around 5 % , then it is fair to say that there are even fewer transgend peopl , and that those that have such an inclin and also commit crime compris an entir small number , said lordkipanidz .
current , upon submit a request to the administr of a penal coloni , homosexu and transgend peopl are alreadi abl to obtain separ condit of confin .
mikhail antipov win the junior world chess championship .
the world chess championship for youth under 20 has finish in khanty-mansiysk .
the end of the championship turn out to be more than a littl intrigu .
the winner was onli decid in the final round , and it was russian mikhail antipov who manag to final overtak the pole , jan-krzysztof duda , who look set to claim the titl .
among the girl , victori was celebr by ukrainian chess player , natalia buksa .
by the middl of the world chess championship , which was held a the begin of septemb in khanty-mansiysk , it look as if there were almost no surpris left , sinc the polish repres , jan-krzysztof duda , who , have deliv a seri of four win ( the tournament is held accord to the swiss system of 13 round ) , confid took the lead .
given that duda was rate as a favourit to win the championship , and general is consid one of the most promis young chess player , the probabl that he would throw away his lead seem rather insignific .
even when duda slow down and allow russian mikhail antipov to narrow the gap to just half a point , he still remain the favourit in the fight for the titl .
after all , antipov absolut had to win in the 13th round in order to surpass the leader .
but even that would n't help if duda won his match .
moreov , this oblig to win could of cours have an impact on the russian chess player 's game and lead to unnecessari mistak .
fortun , mikhail antipov manag to avoid them .
he confid dealt with francesco rambaldi , after which he was forc to wait for duda , who was face benjamin bok , to finish his match .
fortun for antipov , the polish chess player end the stand-off against the dutchman in a draw .
in this way , antipov and duda score an equal number of point - 10 out of a possibl 13 - but antipov had better addit criteria .
it is for this reason that the administr of khanty-mansi autonom area , whose governor is natalia komarova , which tradit pay a lot of attent to the develop of chess in the region , award the grand prize to him .
on the other hand , there were no surpris at the end of the girl ' competit .
the tournament leader , natalia buksa ( ukrain ) , onli need to not lose in the final match to win the titl , which she success did .
thus , the victori of russian alina bivol did n't enabl her to surpass buksa .
the russian athlet place second , just half a point behind the champion .

10-13 % is a comfort rate for invest loan .
accord to expert , the credit market for small and medium busi shrunk by 40 % between januari and april of this year .
in your opinion , what is the situat like today ?
after the panick mood at the end of 2014 and the begin of 2015 , the volum of lend to smes declin signific .
the reason is obvious : a sharp rise in interest rate .
financ at 25-30 % per annum was n't benefici to anyon .
if previous , a bank could place all of it potenti futur problem , from arrear to default , at a higher rate , then now it is no longer possibl to do this : the rate are alreadi sky-high .
for the busi communiti , the current level of interest rate for loan to smes is n't comfort .
for a signific proport of invest project , the current level is unaccept in term of their rate of return .
an interest rate level of between 10-13 % would enabl busi to invest in a wide rang of project and make an attract profit from them .
in your opinion , to what extent is the demand for credit by busi owner be met ?
the situat improv slight after the central bank lower the interest rate .
credit resourc becam more readili avail .
howev , accord to our observ , client have start to appli for loan much more infrequ .
first of all , busi ca n't discern the prospect for their develop or futur earn .
today , busi have one option : they need to learn how to oper by focus on the current econom situat in the countri and the region .
it 's necessari to more close monitor current perform and control cash flow .
at the same time , when financi resourc are avail , it make sens to use new technolog that allow for the modernis of equip and the reduct of product and energi cost .
all this , ultim , enabl compani to make their product more competit and maintain their busi even in an unstabl econom situat .
which main trend in the sme lend market will becom more pronounc and will influenc it develop up until the end of 2015 ?
will the interest rate chang ?
the forecast regard a reduct of the averag rate will depend a lot on the polici of the central bank ; current , the regul is demonstr consist when it come to lower the key rate .
howev , there 's no point in wait for a drastic declin in the cost of credit for smes .
in the current situat , the problem , first and foremost , is inflat , which necessit a higher interest rate to obtain real earn .
moreov , the cost of money in russia will remain high even with a lower of rate by the central bank .
if we re talk about the level of arrear , then tradit , small and medium size busi , limit by their abil to replenish fund , as well as by possibl for adjust econom behaviour , will , of cours , present a big risk to lender .
i would n't expect a signific reduct in the share of bad loan .
the main reason is intern sanction and their negat impact on the countri 's economi .

at their most anticip meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week seat around a 27-foot honduran mahogani tabl decid if it 's time to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
loom over them at one end of the central bank 's ornat , two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to put the nation 's econom interest abov all other .
the central bank has a dual charg from congress : maxim u.s. employ and keep price here stabl .
but sinc the great recess , fed leader have acknowledg that there 's an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and that third mandat could be the x-factor in a too-close-to-predict decis , to be announc thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to start be wean from the unpreced stimulus provid by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
even though most data show the economi grow solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market could make already-cauti fed offici skittish about ad to the volatil by rais their benchmark feder fund rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious the labor market and inflat is go to be first and foremost the most import thing they watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais the rate , the increas uncertainti surround the global marketplac is enough to provid them with justif to wait further , '' she said .
there 's no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is caus financi market jitter .
about half of economist survey recent by bloomberg predict a rate increas this week .
financi market , howev , are expect the fed to hold off , with a key indic show onli about a 30 % chanc of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed rais the rate , unless policymak were to soften the blow by promis that anoth increas would be a way off .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228.89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that fed policymak will hold the rate steadi this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed hike rate at this point in time , '' he said .
if fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to great length in their polici statement to hold financi market ' hand so they do n't panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seem on track to rais the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would valid the strength of the u.s. recoveri .
yellen had said through the spring and earli summer that she expect a rate increas this year despit complaint from liber that more econom progress was need .
although job creation slow in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate drop to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year and near the level the fed consid to be full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and although inflat continu to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , fed policymak said a key reason was the temporari effect of sharpli lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate , and need them , given the tight of the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world start convuls late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag drop as much as 16 % below it record high in may as investor fear a slow chines economi would drag down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , with the dow now down near 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymak , the market turmoil add to the complex calculus of when to rais the interest rate .
`` absent what happen in financi market and the news about the weak in the chines economi over the past coupl week , they would be tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he predict they ll wait at least a month to get a better handl on the effect .
`` there 's a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the u.s. economi are go to be , and they have almost no data to reli on that post-dat the develop in china , '' olin said .
the health of the global economi is n't one of the fed 's primari concern , so technic it should n't be factor into it decision-mak .
but , in effect , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint by then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed might `` taper '' it monetari expans trigger market convuls around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , fed offici can be expect not onli to monitor the develop elsewher but also to consult with other central banker and expert to get a better read on the global economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of overreact to financi market movement that seem unconnect to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe who has been push for a rate increas , cite decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
a financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over three meet `` despit limit identifi implic for u.s. growth , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici revers those cut .
the fed should put financi stabil concern first onli dure a major crisi , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's rate-set committe .
the latest turmoil doe n't come close to that level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be put in a situat of be scare of a rate hike becaus market got upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv act still has the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that is chang , i do n't think they should get ahead of the curv .

but , in general , i do n't think it 's good for an athlet to live for their old victori and run through their success race over and over again .
i onli bask in my victori for two or three day and then i had to start move again .
did your prepar for this remark season differ signific from usual ?
i ca n't say that there was anyth particular differ .
we start to train back in decemb , but i skip the winter competit season .
at first , i train at home in barnaul , then at train camp , and then again at home .
as per usual .
but my coach and i set a goal : to tri and reach a new level where i had never been befor .
i spent almost the entir winter lay down the foundat for this .
i ran lot of cross-countri , did exercis for overal physic condit , which includ lift and squat , and we built up my back muscl .
then we move onto hurdl train , and work a lot on techniqu .
did you keep an eye on how your competitor were perform ?
i alway tri and do this , and it 's an advantag of the internet age that there are n't ani issu with this .
i watch the european winter championship , and the french swept the whole podium in sprint hurdl !
then i thought : i need to do someth to break up this group .
with each race this season , you kept on improv your result .
did this give you confid ?
all of my previous season have unfold in pretti much the same way .
there was never a time when i was first run 13.20 and then would run 13.50 .
i alway work out my form gradual .
the most import thing is that i want to run it in under 13 second .
everi effort was direct , first and foremost , on achiev this result .
but the paradox is that , even though you feel prepar for this feat , you are n't alway abl to show your readi to do this at competit .
like how it was at the london olymp for exampl ?
to be honest , i tri to forget that semi-fin race right away ( shubenkov was n't abl to make it to the final - ed . ) .
i was veri well prepar , and could have run it in under 13 second .
and even if i had repeat my best result at that time , i would have been the bronz medallist at the game .
but it just did n't work out .
do you rememb your first world championship ?
what do you think ?
it was in daegu .
i realli want to make it into the final back then ; that was kind of the ultim goal .
but i got knock out first thing in the morn , dure the preliminari race .
that 's when i understood that reckless rush headlong into it meant that i was n't go to get anywher .
two year later at the world championship in moscow , i had alreadi made it into the final with a better time .
i rememb well how i felt befor the final race : i realli want to win the gold even back then !
how do you manag to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out ?
well , this is the most difficult thing .
you need to be care and focus on techniqu in order to not knock down the hurdl .
i ve notic that when you are n't fixat on the end result , but on the process , it 's a lot easier .
but the greatest rush is when you realis that you re run and everyth seem to be work out on it own !
honest , it 's well worth it .
a lot of our athlet from the provinc aim to move closer to the capit after their first notabl success .
have you ever had those thought ?
home is alway better .
and i ca n't even imagin where i 'd be without my coach ; who need me ?
it might be nice to have slight better condit , but i tri to be content with what i have .
have you and klevtsovi been togeth for a long time ?
sinc i was 12 year old , when i first start track and field .
actual , i start train with his wife , who work with the children , and then later she pass me on .
i start with sprint , then long jump and tripl jump .
there was a children 's combin event : that 's when they toss a ball and long jump from that spot ...
at 14 , i tri the hurdl and like them .
with my veri first race , i was abl to qualifi for the second adult categori .
so i just stay with it .
have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdl ?
somehow i was abl to work thing out with them right away .
but i ve alway had to put a lot of work into my techniqu .
i work for so long on just one stride !
but there is no way around this routin .
your techniqu need to be constant hone , so that you could wake me up in the middl of the night , and i would get up and run hurdl .
everyon that saw your race in beij claim that it was a realli beauti race .
thank you .
i quit enjoy it myself .
usual i do n't re-watch my race , but with this one i could n't hold myself back .
but you have to keep work on effici : there 's alway room for improv .
are you now afraid that a victori one year befor the olymp game will weigh like a heavi burden on your shoulder ?
as peopl say in situat like this : i will tri to live up to expect .
sinc i ve chosen to take this road , that mean that i have to see it through to the end .
my coach love to say : if you re not a weakl , you should n't feel ani extra weight .
and i complet agre with him on this .
otar kushanashvili
well i 'm not so naïv as to have been stun by the reaction to the interview that took place in ukrain .
peopl are pissed-off , i get it ; there 's noth they like better than give the enemi the boot .
and even though i did n't wrap myself in the flag , i ve said the same thing , the exact same thing a million time here : i never direct call anyon a bastard - someth els bother me .
all of my pseudo-friend , in an instant , in a second , vanish somewher .
the pressur that i have been deal with is so strong that even a person like me , who has been around the block more than a few time , think that peopl have gone crazi .
it 's as if you re walk along by yourself and a mob just start attack you and , well , beat you with stick .
but you have to know me , i 'm no pushov , if they come at me with their fist , i will strike back with a howitz ; i 'm a veteran , guy , be afraid .
the total lack of support is a whole other matter .
i did n't realli have ani illus , but now ...
my best qualiti has alway been self-suffici , so just tri me .
but onli idiot could give passport to degener like fred durst or monson .
it would have been better to give it to me , the best journalist , someon from an honour profess .
a week ago in kiev , otar kushanashvili did n't minc word when describ event in crimea :
what they did with the crimean peninsula is a crime .
this is what they call an annex .
i assum that the refer to how a tipsi khrushchev attempt to sign someth by no mean fit into the overal pictur of human societi .
it 's like visit your neighbour and take away his home ...
the war start with the kremlin , and it will onli come to an end there .
i am almost 100 % sure that , like in the summer of 2008 , it start with a phone call from some bastard within the confin of the kremlin .
i have a hunch who it might have been ...
kobzon doe n't have all that much longer to live .
i do n't understand , he 's a great artist , whi doe he need to lick putin 's boot .
is he lose his apart or someth ?
so , they took down his statu .
for sure , after all , peopl rememb him as someon who insult his small motherland .
but now , reconcili depend entir on vladimir vladimirovich .

for mild obes diabet , weight loss surgeri may be help
the benefit of weight loss surgeri for mild obes peopl with type 2 diabet can last at least five year , accord to a new studi .
it 's still to earli to say whether mild obes peopl with diabet live longer after weight loss surgeri than those who receiv non-surg treatment , howev .
`` the mortal data take a long time to show up , '' said dr. robin blackston , a weight loss surgeri expert who wrote an editori on the new studi in jama surgeri .
weight loss oper , or bariatr surgeri , use various method to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduc hunger and limit the bodi 's abil to absorb food .
over the year , bariatr surgeri have prove effect for treat type 2 diabet , but most studi were done in peopl who are morbid obes , with a bodi mass index ( bmi ) of 35 or abov .
bmi , a measur of weight in relat to height , is consid normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a bmi of 25 or higher indic that someon is overweight , and peopl with a bmi over 30 are consid obes .
you can calcul your bmi here : 1.usa.gov/1d0zqdv .
for the new studi , research from taiwan 's min-sheng general hospit use data collect sinc 2007 in a trial compar two kind of bariatr surgeri - gastric bypass and sleev gastrectomi - to medic treatment for type 2 diabet in peopl who were mild obes .
the averag bmi among those who had surgeri fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the studi .
meanwhil , the bmi among those receiv non-surg diabet treatment stay about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgeri , diabet resolv complet in 36 percent and partial in 28 percent .
in the medically-tr group , by comparison , diabet resolv complet in onli 1 percent and partial in onli about 2 percent .
in addit , control of blood pressur , triglycerid , and `` bad '' ldl cholesterol `` was general better in the surgic group , '' the author found .
the research also monitor patient ' blood level of hemoglobin a1c , which reflect blood sugar level over time .
hemoglobin a1c is best kept below 7 percent , the research write .
after surgeri , the averag hemoglobin a1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medic therapi group , howev , it remain steadi at about 8 percent .
but this better `` glycem control '' - as reflect by the improv hemoglobin a1c level - did not reduc the mortal rate at five year , accord to lead research dr. chih-cheng hsu and colleagu .
the research team also compar averag outcom with the two type of surgeri .
at the fifth year , compar to the sleev gastrectomi group , the bypass surgeri group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs 14.2 kg ) , achiev larger drop in bmi ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in hemoglobin a1c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more like to have complet diabet remiss ( 46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent ) .
while the new studi doe not show a surviv benefit or surgeri after five year , there is evid from a studi of heavier peopl in sweden that surgeri doe lead to a longer life , say blackston , of the univers of arizona colleg of medicine-phoenix .
in the swedish studi , obes peopl who had bariatr surgeri were about 29 percent less like to die over 15 year , compar to a group who tri more convent method .
though the new studi did n't show a benefit in surviv among surgeri patient , blackston said it 's reassur for peopl with a bmi under 35 interest in the procedur .
`` this is where this paper is critic , becaus it say this surgeri is safe in that lower bmi group , '' with no increas risk of death or renal diseas , she said .
blackston ad that peopl and their doctor should start take weight serious onc the patient 's bmi fall between 27 and 30 .
`` i think we wait too long to get peopl to be serious about this , '' she said .
i think that onc they ve accumul these genet chang that hardwir their bodi into obes and diabet , revers that is realli hard .

onli 23 hotel in saint petersburg have the right to hous the tourist who will arriv in 2018 to watch the world cup in footbal .
so far , the rest of the hotel have n't been rush to get the necessari permit .
accord to expert , this is a veri worrisom sign .
in the lead up to the world championship , the author need to urgent figur out how to accommod all the citi 's guest .
rosbalt 's inform believ that apart rent will rise by 10-30 % as a result of the tournament , and , even after the championship , it will be necessari to pay through the nose for rent accommod .
the world championship in footbal has forc the author to take a look at the state of russian hotel .
accord to a law specif written for the championship , everi hotel in saint petersburg must undergo a classif procedur and prove that they meet their alleg star rate and level of servic .
it is alreadi clear that not everyon will manag to do this : hoteli are so apprehens about the screen process that they frequent are n't even submit request document to the feder antimonopoli servic for saint petersburg .
head of the offic of the feder antimonopoli servic , vadim vladimirov , say that the agenc has investig 138 hotel and now plan on initi 34 case against hotel , mani of which have simpli not respond to fas staff .
there are sign that the manag of thirti compani were deceiv citi resid by alleg a certain number of star in advertis , vladimirov note .
the problem is that now , ahead of 2018 , liter not even one room from the overal total can be lost .
offici suspect that dure the footbal championship , fan will occupi all of saint petersburg 's hotel .
current , tourist can depend on 30,500 room in the citi .
accord to data from the smolni institut , there are 17 five-star hotel , 51 four-star hotel , 100 two and three-star hotel , and 550 one-star hotel in saint petersburg .
accord to first deputi of the committe for the develop of tourism , nana gvichiya , at the present moment , onli 23 hotel have undergon classif : this is the number of inspect that have been conduct by the compani accredit in saint petersburg .
howev , the smolni institut , for a surpris set of circumst , doe n't know whether or not some hotel could have order a similar procedur from region busi .
in other word , there may be more hotel that have undergon classif , but no one know about it .
`` over the past six month , hotel have not been veri interest in undergo classif '' , admit the director of the northwestern branch of the russian tourism industri union , ekaterina shadskaya .
this is explain by it be peak season , the time when hoteli make the most money and do n't want to be deal with other issu .
anoth reason is their budget , which did n't includ expens for inspect , especi sinc the procedur could cost a hotel , depend on it status , between 30 thousand to 100 thousand roubl or more .
howev , more recent , hotel manag have woken up and start to appli for classif , assur shadskaya .
hotel must get this done by juli 1 , 2016 ; otherwis , they will not onli have to pay a fine , but also will not receiv the right to oper dure the world championship .
it is alreadi well known that , base on star rate , a set rate per hotel room for the durat of the tournament will be develop .
the formula , accord to which price will be set , will be publish next year .
this is done to ensur that there is n't a 200-300 % spike in price , as happen , for exampl , dure the saint petersburg econom forum .
you have to have a conscienc and prevent a two-threefold price hike , while also enabl hotel to make money .
`` i think there will be a 50 % increas '' , explain presid of the russian hotel associ , gennadi lamshin .
wherea vadim vladimirov is n't convinc that fix price correspond with the notion of a free market economi .
i do n't know how well it fit within the framework of econom theori , but i hope that this measur is justifi .
`` it 's better than rampant price increas '' , he note .
it 's not clear what will happen with popular inexpens hostel .
state duma deputi have introduc a bill that would prohibit hostel in residenti build .
we realli hope that this law is not adopt or that it wo n't appli to saint petersburg .
`` we will defend our point of view , that hostel should be maintain '' , say nana gvachiya .
howev , accord to her , owner of mini-hotel , should , in ani case , be readi for a tighten of the hous code .
if the state duma end up approv the bill , then approxim 80 % of the hostel in saint petersburg will be close , and current , they account for 1,500 room .
accord to the presid of the feder of restaurateur and hoteli for the northwest , leonid garbar , there are n't enough two and three-star hotel in saint petersburg , which are exact what footbal fan are look for , wherea there is an overabund of four and five-star hotel .
this state of affair is equival to a situat where `` you have 75 thousand vip in an 80-thousand-person stadium '' .
in fact , make use of mini-hotel can solv this issu .
the expert consid their possibl ban to be `` idioci '' : `` i find it strang that some peopl can live in apart , but out-of-town , for some reason , can not '' .
if a hostel is be use like a dormitori , then i agre that this is not right .
but if it is be use like a hotel , where guest stay for a short period of time , then whi not ?
mini-hotel also risk miss out dure the world championship in footbal as a result of their own foot-drag .
hundr of small hotel will simpli not manag to undergo classif in time , what 's more is that they are dig their own hole .
by the summer of 2016 , all the citi 's hotel will be book inspect .
`` there are n't that mani compani that are allow to carri out this procedur , and , as such , they will turn down the less profit order from mini-hotel and will choos those that are more expens '' , note gennadi lamshin , ad that , in a number of citi , for exampl , moscow and volgograd , the figur for those that have alreadi complet inspect is current much higher than for those in saint petersburg .
the reason for saint petersburg 's delay is relat in part to constant chang in the govern 's tourism unit , which has not be conduc to coordin effort .
accord to expert , if there are n't enough hotel in saint petersburg for everyon , then , most like , attent will have to be shift toward region hotel and health resort .
just as dure the celebr of saint petersburg 's 300th anniversari , a river fleet could be mobilis , which would enabl tournament guest to stay in ship cabin .
besid , mani fan have arrang to arriv in van , in which they could spend the night .
`` the main thing is to not build so mani hotel , that they later end up sit empti '' , assur gennadi lamshin .
rent accommod will also be veri popular dure the footbal championship .
a pool of apart avail for rent in the citi will most like be creat .
rental rate will rise by 10-30 % .
`` obvious , the first to go will be hous near the stadium '' , note rent specialist for the agenc for the develop and studi of real estat , larisa bragina .
moreov , rent price might not return to previous level after the championship , especi in commut communiti .
this will also contribut to the construct of new traffic interchang on the outskirt of the citi , she underscor .
one should n't forget about the human qualiti of citi resid .
for exampl , leonid garbar insist that saint petersburg has alway been a welcom citi , where peopl not onli provid you with direct , but might also take you on a mini-excurs .
there can also be complic .
sometim around 1970 , my father met a famili from murmansk in the courtyard : a father , mother , and two children .
it turn out they had nowher to spend the night : get a hotel was difficult back then and sleep at the train station was tough .
`` so my father let them into our communal apart to sleep '' , our interviewe recal .
of cours , he ad that , nowaday , this type of trait no longer exist amongst the citi 's resid - invit someon into your home is fraught with consequ and frighten .
but , perhap , in 2018 , after the ill-fat decis of the state duma , and the mistak of hoteli and the govern , we might be requir to recal the past ?
zhirinovski `` lose '' amur region .
today , i watch the buffooneri of zhirinovski in the state duma with admir .
he was do these thing when our generat was still learn how to sell newspap , and remain in excel form to this veri day .
the theme of the address was someth along the line of `` ldpr 's protest against the result of the elect in amur region '' .
he ca n't wave around protocol that he doe n't have ; by all account , ldpr doe n't have ani other protocol than those sign by the elector commiss .
then he bring up the second place winner , ivan abramov , and yell someth like : `` here 's the winner of the elect ! ''
and then , from no reason , he start attack rodina , and then , after the ruckus with the chairperson this time , he lead the fraction out of the meet hall , while liter cri out : `` all of you and your front are crook and thiev '' .
the press , of cours , place the emphasi not on abramov , but on the scandal and the fraction 's walkout as a consequ of this scandal and insult .
in realiti , volfovich beauti and eleg lost amur region along with abramov .
for the whole countri , this was just anoth one of zhirinovski 's escapad in the same vein as his `` scumbag ! '' tirad , and not at all a protest by a polit parti against the result of an actual elect .
yet the fraction has formal made a row of it , and the elect , if we are to believ the parti 's websit and ivan abramov 's facebook account , have not been confirm , but the leader has obvious back away from the issu .
he let the dead in amur buri their own dead , but then he preach against unit russia in general , and against rodina , which is guilti of noth at all .
an eleg solut to save face and , for the time be , avoid a loud scandal .
it 's an entir differ matter that abramov now find himself in an odd posit .
other than an outcri from the leadership , he was n't expect anyth : there are no altern protocol avail .
on the one hand , he is n't the focus of the public 's attent , but on the other , for a small circl of peopl , he becam the formal reason for both an insult against a respect champion , and , even more import , boorish attack against unit russia and the all-russia peopl 's front ( apf ) .
and here , of cours , it 's necessari for him to think veri serious about what need to be done .
becaus he could turn from be the main beneficiari of the elect , the number 2 politician in the region , and the number 1 candid in the onli region single-seat constitu , into a pariah who was success use by his own parti 's leadership and it provocateur-extraordinair for the benefit of that same apf and someon els 's parti leadership .
well , if zhirinovski did n't exist , then it definit would be necessari to invent him and duti follow his everi move .
trump has a lot of work to do to catch up with him .
there is news that ldpr will return to the hall dure the next plenari session .
that is to say : all that fuss for noth .
onli , the abramov issu has been buri under itself .
it 's beauti realli .

how the oldest children 's librari in barnaul becam a famili club .
a sad cast iron owl sit on the back of a bench by the entranc to the n. k. krupskaya region children 's librari .
the kid who come for book tri to feed it candi .
sever generat alreadi have been come to this librari over the past 95 year .
the first librari patron , from the twenti of the previous centuri , arrang loud read , stage perform base on mayakovski 's poem , held literari quizz , and correspond with lenin 's wife .
the correspond last for four year , and , as the newspap `` young stalinist '' wrote , in 1939 , `` the friendship between nadezhda konstantinovna krupskaya and the friend of the children 's librari in the citi of barnaul '' grew stronger each day .
one time , nadezhda konstantinovna even sent her faraway friend in barnaul a childhood photograph of her .
and when the barnaul resid ask if nadezhda konstantinovna would mind if the librari was name after her , she wrote that , no , she did n't mind .
the letter have been collect dust in the museum for a long time , and it 's necessari to explain to the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the first patron exact whose stern profil decor the bas-relief on the librari build .
dure the perestroika year , all sort of peopl would often call , fill with indign : whi has n't the children 's librari been renam ?
the librari should be name after some nice children 's writer , without polit overton !
the librari staff sat down togeth , thought about it , and decid to leav thing as they were .
`` krupskaya '' is probabl the most well-known and best-lov librari in barnaul , just like the lenin librari in moscow .
on the floor of the librari 's lobbi there is a pathway made from yellow brick .
`` the wizard of the emerald citi '' is the favourit theme of artist olya moskovka .
previous , olya was a manag at a law firm ; she came into work at eight and left at five , and onli differ from the other manag in her love of draw .
then she found an onlin advertis : `` book illustr need '' .
the book was written by a littl american girl and it was call `` my cancer mommi '' ( `` my mama has cancer '' ) .
olya did the illustr and thought : life can end at ani moment , and there wo n't be ani miracl in it if you do n't creat them yourself .
now she work at the librari , illustr the children 's book of author from around the world , and write her own short stori .
typic , it 's believ that children are lose interest in book ; that they are increas live in some kind of virtual univers ...
but children who read visit us , and their parent understand the valu of read , the librari 's director , tatiana kushvid , tell russian planet .
in recent year , we ve even felt a sens of confid , that the children 's librari is need , and that it will keep on go - the kid are come here !
i think an interest in read is make a comeback .
a larg display window with a temporari photo exhibit hang in the librari 's lobbi .
onc everi quarter , new photograph of librari patron that come to the librari as a famili - mom , dad , and kid - are hung up .
the librari is thrill that father have start to come more frequent to the librari with their children .
if they were read all of chukovski when they were two year old , then when they are older , they need more challeng book .
but now , there is a law wherebi we ca n't give an eight-year-old wunderkind book that are from the 12 and older categori .
in order to get this book , the child must bring their parent with them ; so they come , and come back again , and , slowli but sure , krupskaya is becom someth like a famili club for them .
the librari contain treasur : a pre-revolutionari collect of folk tale with the old letter `` yat '' and hard sign , stori by korolenko in a supplement to the magazin `` niva '' , and a bound file of `` murzilka '' magazin for 1936 .
after all , nowaday we re not just a conceptu space , a `` templ of book '' , we re now open for movement , and we re tri to becom a special place : not home , not work , not school , explain tatiana kushvid .
you can come to us so that everyon can read togeth , play togeth , and draw togeth .
we creat a play area for young children : the child has onli come to play , but their hand still reach out for a book !
the parent of some of our patron have to drag their children out , but they dig their heel in and do n't want to leav .
mom with their stroller often visit us , and we are realli happi that the librari come first amongst all the other place they need to take their babi .
tatiana kushvid say : today 's kid are the same as we use to be ; they love classic children 's literatur :
`` the publish industri is grow right now , and a lot of attent is be paid to author who are the link between generat '' .
if we re talk about littl children , then it 's import for them that there be some sort of a charact that travel from one book to anoth .
children do n't like to say goodby to their favourit charact .
the librari is alway publish booklet for parent that talk about what 's go on in the world of children 's literatur , which book are worth pay attent to , and whi .
the booklet are so fascin and intrigu that the adult ask whether or not the librari is in fact for them .
adult are n't allow to borrow book from the librari .
onli children have this magic privileg .
... in the furthermost room of the librari , there is a squar hatch with an antiqu wooden staircas that lead to the basement , into the archiv room .
the step will creak with each step you take : it 's a veri old time machin .
you ll meet a book from your childhood as if it were an old comrad : hi , it 's wonder that we have n't chang a bit .
elli still happili walk along the road pave with yellow brick ; lazi tolya ryzhikov steal the magic match ; and malchish kibalchish still has n't told the curs bourgeouin the militari secret , such is his solemn word .
these book are like password : you can use them to recognis your peopl anywher .
there are also real literari rariti in the archiv room : for exampl , a pre-revolutionari collect of folk tale with the old letter `` yat '' and hard sign .
or stori by korolenko in a well-known supplement to the magazin `` niva '' .
or a bound file of `` murzilka '' magazin for 1936 .
time has age the page , turn them a tea-lik colour .
these public are n't given out to librari patron anymor .
these are part of our futur collect ; i 'm alway dream of retir and work with rare children 's book .
but children wo n't , so to speak , buy into this anymor : the colour in the old book are n't veri bright , and the theme ... you open the first page and there 's lenin , the parti , and the komsomol .
now , i think : whi did we all subscrib to this `` pioneer truth '' ?
but still , it was interest , galina ilyasova , head of the archiv room , tell russian planet .
the page of `` murzilka '' have darken with age .
galina vasilevna has been in-charg of the archiv room her entir life .
she know what colour buratino 's cap is , in which school year harri potter becam captain for gryffindor at the quidditch championship , in which situat carlson use his motor silenc , and what alisa selezneva 's father doe for a live .
a librarian receiv littl pay for their work , and those who can live without these row of book quick find themselv anoth profess .
onli the most dedic remain : educ , teacher , and servant of the cult of the book .
you can even tell who they are by their smile : it 's said that this is a profession trait of a children 's librarian .
if they smile at you within the first minut of a convers , then they are a profession .
i just love children 's book : as a librarian , i like that they are here , that they are sit nice and tidi on the shelv , and i also love to read them , say galina vasilevna .
i read everyth : militari and histor stori , fairi tale , fiction .
i read contemporari russian author , the latest translat ...
of cours , i think that thing were differ in my childhood .
back then , book were the most interest and excit thing that had ever happen to me .
and this is whi i love them mad ; i felt that the librari was a magic place .
and i want to work there , where everyon sit and read .
i hope that book will alway be around , in spite of reader .
and i 'm delight when our former librari patron bring in their children , and even their grandchildren ...

it would offer a uniqu perspect .
true , journalist are permit to watch execut in america and becaus there are often more applic than seat avail , a macabr lotteri take place to decid who will be chosen .
oklahoma has reduc the number of media seat from 12 to five .
whoever is pick will watch it dispassion .
i can not do that .

i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison author say i can not be both a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be allow a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to tri to rememb all the detail .
one oklahoma journalist accus me on twitter of compromis my imparti .
here 's the lesson .
tell the inmat 's stori the way he like it , get access .
i complain to her .
she admit that she `` could have phrase it better , '' but still think i 'm wrong to do what i 'm do .
richard glossip has taken issu with some of the thing i ve said and written .
he doe n't tell me what to write , and i would n't do it even if he did .
i ve told him he can remov me from his list of wit at ani time .

i wo n't go over all the detail again here .
i can not say with certainti that richard glossip is innoc .
his action after the murder of barri van trees would make him guilti of be an accessori after the fact .

i certain believ there was not enough evid to justifi a death sentenc .
i believ his execut is wrong .
and it 's from this perspect that i will watch him die .

our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tri in our game but is that excit footi ?
or is it make break and not score tri that is excit ?
to me it 's agenda .
if they are mention us it mean that at some stage we might meet them there .

that best-cas scenario alreadi mean that wilsher is certain to miss at least the next four england game and , given his histori , his involv in next summer 's european championship is clear uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that wilsher had finish last season strong after a separ ankl injuri and then look back to his old sharp dure pre-season .
`` this kind of injuri is not career-threaten , '' said wenger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is noth major .
this was just an accid .
it was not link with his ankl or with the injuri he had befor .
that might be true from a pure medic perspect but , as wenger also acknowledg , there is the relat danger of further injuri whenev ani player tri to return midseason .
there is also an uncomfort pattern develop .
research by premier injuri ltd record 23 differ wilsher ailment sinc he made his debut six year ago .
he has also play in onli 65 of arsenal 's 157 leagu game dure the last five season .
the wider pictur for arsenal is that in six out of eight season sinc 2007-08 , they have been one of the two premier leagu club to lose most day through injuri .
wenger accept the potenti of a vicious circl but arsenal believ that an improv in their injuri record dure last season will continu .
`` sometim , when you are come back from an injuri , you have a vulner period , a time when you need to strengthen your bodi and gain competit , '' said wenger .
jack is young enough to get over that .
i hope his bodi stabilis , i am confid it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserv .
with arsenal begin their champion leagu campaign on wednesday night against dinamo zagreb ahead of match with chelsea on saturday and tottenham hotspur next wednesday , wenger is prepar to rotat his team .
héctor bellerín and aaron ramsey have not travel to croatia , mean mathieu debuchi and arteta are like to start .

`` i tri to keep the balanc and give a littl breather to player who need it , '' said wenger .
although arsenal are clear favourit to progress through group f , the maksimir stadium in zagreb is among europ 's most intimid .
dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 match after produc their own `` invinc '' campaign last season .
the stadium was shaken on tuesday night by an earth tremor that measur 3.2 on the richter .
it was the 10th in zagreb this year .
wenger believ that arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season 's champion leagu capitul against monaco and remain driven by the distant hope of manag the club to a first european cup triumph .
`` this drive is immens , '' said wenger .
it has never been done at arsenal .
we were veri close in 2006 but , on the other hand , i am long enough to be realist .

vesti economi - nobel laureat : globalis
print the process of globalis should have help to reduc inequ in the world .
in practic , the situat look entir differ ; the incom gap in develop economi is , on the contrari , grow .
eric maksin .
to correct this , it is necessari to rais the level of educ of low-skil worker , say chief research fellow at the intern laboratori of decis choic and analysi at the nation research univers , higher school of econom ( nru hse ) , and 2007 nobel prize laureat in econom , eric maksin .
over the past twenti year , the world has experienc unpreced growth in global market .
trade border between countri have becom increas more open .
propon of globalis predict great benefit for develop economi .
`` and these predict have to a great extent come true '' , maksin underscor .
so , for exampl , china and india achiev signific gdp per capita growth .
howev , not everyth is so rosi .
it was expect that globalis would narrow the gap between the `` have '' and the `` have-not '' in poor countri , which present itself in the form of incom inequ , or , to be more exact , wage .
but , in realiti , this inequ onli becam more pronounc , eric maksin point out in his articl `` whi global market have n't reduc inequ in develop economi '' , which was publish in the world bank econom review , and was translat and quot by the nri hse .
eric maksin , in cooper with the economist and professor from harvard univers , michael kremer , develop an altern theori , which demonstr whi incom inequ increas in poor countri in proport to the growth of globalis , nri hse recal .
specif process are at play in the new global market .
in order to demonstr them , maksin distinguish four skill level for specialist : a and b for wealthi countri , and c and d for poor one .
after globalis , the d specialist from poor countri do n't have the requir skill level to cooper with specialist a and b from wealthi countri .
and while the wage of c level worker from poor countri rise thank to cooper with b colleagu from wealthi one , d worker either do n't experi the same effect or their salari total plung .
the result effect is that the internationalis of product will lead to an increas in the wage gap between these two categori of specialist in poor countri and , consequ , increas level of inequ .
kremer and e. maksin have propos a remark beauti model , an altern to the ricardian theori of compar advantag .
it make it possibl to explain whi globalis has led to incom inequ , say fuad aleskerov , tenur professor , head of the intern laboratori of decis choic and analysi , and head of the depart of mathemat at nri hse .
and , like ani power theori , i am sure it will lead to an upsurg of empir work in this field .
the solut to the problem , in eric maksin 's opinion , is to improv the level of educ of low-skil worker .
howev , the worker themselv , the academ note , do n't have the money for this , and it 's not profit for compani to pay for their train .
in a situat like this , govern , intern agenc , ngos , and privat foundat can play a signific role , maksin believ .
the academ note that the develop theori in no way call for an end to the process of globalis , which has brought and will bring benefit in the form of gdp growth of countri .
