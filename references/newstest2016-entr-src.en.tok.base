8 poll number that show donald trump is for real
some have tri to label him a flip-flopp .
other have dismiss him as a joke .
and some are hold out for an implos .
but no matter how some republican are tri to drag donald trump down from atop the poll , it has n't work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 nation poll have shown donald trump 's lead at doubl digit , and some are start to ask serious what it mean for the real estat mogul 's nomin chanc .
of cours , it 's still earli in the elect cycl .
none of this is to say that trump is like to win the republican nomin .
pundit point out that at this time in 2011 , rick perri 's lead was give way to a rise herman cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomin process .
and there are mani reason he would struggl in a general elect .
but outsid group like jeb bush 's super pac and the econom conserv group club for growth are recogn trump 's stay power and begin to unload their dollar to toppl him .
here are some recent poll number that suggest that the real estat mogul is n't just a pass phase :
trump 's favor rate have turn 180 degre .
right befor donald trump announc his candidaci in mid-jun , a monmouth univers poll show onli two in 10 republican had a posit view of the real estat mogul .
by mid-juli , it was 40 percent .
in earli august , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 republican have a favor view of donald trump .
rough three in 10 say they have a negat view .
and these number hold up in earli state .
a quinnipiac poll in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republican there had a favor view of trump .
two-third of gop voter would be happi with trump as the nomine .
in a cnn/orc poll last week , 67 percent of republican said they would be either `` enthusiast '' or `` satisfi '' if trump were the nomine .
onli two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nomine .
onli ben carson generat rough the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiast '' vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with onli 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of republican voter say they would be `` dissatisfi '' or `` upset '' if establish favorit jeb bush becom the nomine .
a major of republican do n't see trump 's tempera as a problem .
while donald trump has been wide critic for his bombast and insult , 52 percent of lean republican voter nationwid think that the real estat mogul has the right tempera to be presid , accord to monday 's abc news/washington post poll .
the same number hold in the first-in-the-n caucus state of iowa , where the same 52 percent of republican think he has the person to be command in chief , accord to quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doe n't have the person to serv effect , and almost six in 10 independ say his tempera doe not belong in the white hous , accord to abc/post .
republican voter are get use to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hat , republican voter think trump is for real .
when ask who is most like to win the gop nomin , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , accord to a cnn/orc poll out last week .
that 's a chang from when four in 10 place their money on jeb bush in late juli .
full disclosur : gop voter have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycl , four in 10 republican pick rick perri to win the nomin , vs. onli 28 percent for eventu nomine mitt romney .
still , it show that a plural of gop voter see trump 's campaign as plausibl .
even if republican ralli around anoth candid , trump still beat almost everyon .
some pundit point out that the splinter field is like contribut to trump 's lead , while anti-trump support is be spread diffus among more than a dozen other candid .
but a monmouth univers poll in earli septemb show that , in a hypothet head-to-head matchup between trump and most other republican candid , trump almost alway garner major support .
he lead car fiorina by 13 point , marco rubio by 14 point , walker by 15 point , jeb bush by 19 point , and , final , rand paul , john kasich and chris christi by 33 point each .
he 's in a dead heat with ted cruz .
the onli candid who beat him ?
ben carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 point in a hypothet head-to-head .
a bare major of donald trump 's support say they ve made up their mind .
a new cbs/nyt poll out on tuesday show that just more than half of voter who support trump say they have lock in their vote .
obvious , a lot can happen to chang that , and no one can realli say they would never chang their mind .
46 percent said they are leav the door open to switch candid .
still , trump 's strongest competit at the moment is from fellow outsid neurosurgeon ben carson , but voter who say they have made up their mind are twice as like to go for trump .
six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr .
even sinc donald trump call immigr from mexico `` rapist '' in his campaign announc speech two month ago , immigr has been front and center in the 2016 convers .
some are worri that trump 's bombast will drive crucial hispan voter away from the republican parti and damag rebrand effort .
but accord to monday 's new abc/post poll , six in 10 republican say they agre with trump on immigr issu .
so as long as immigr remain in the spotlight , it seem donald trump will remain too .
frustrat with govern is climb to new high .
donald trump and ben carson now account for rough half of the support from republican voter , larg due to their outsid status .
six in 10 republican in monday 's new abc/post poll say they want a polit outsid over someon with govern experi .
and they are angri at washington , too .
a des moin register/bloomberg poll in iowa from two week ago show that three in four iowa republican are frustrat with republican in congress , with 54 percent `` unsatisfi '' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . ''

he did break a racquet when he lost when he cramp in the us , but he 's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustrat with himself , and i know thanasi well enough to know he would n't be proud of that .
but , realli , he 's handl himself extrem well , in pretti provoc circumst in the us with harrison and so on , and i think he deserv a lot of credit .
he 's a great team around him , he 's got a great famili around him and i just think he 's been a littl hard done by .
he 's a veri matur 19-year-old , he work veri hard , and he fit in with the team and so on , he has n't ever had an issu with the other player , he 's well respect in the locker room , he train hard , he 's in great shape , he 's a veri stabl and matur young guy and i just think he deserv to be judg on his own merit .

here 's what will happen when the fed rais interest rate
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumbl , bond yield will climb and the economi will slip into a recess .
this we know .
what we do n't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economi specif , histori offer littl guid about time .
a recess has come as quick as 11 month after the first rate hike and as long as 86 month .
the feder reserv 's aggress in rais rate is often , though not alway , a determin in how the economi and financi asset respond .
that 's whi offici at the u.s. central bank have stress so vigor that investor should not be focus on when it start rais rate but rather the trajectori of how long it will take to normal .
there are , inde , multipl variabl at play .
in the end , howev , market particip may find that all the rate-hik fuss may have been overdon .
`` the first hike from the fed sinc the global financi crisi will inevit be interpret by some as signal the end of the era of cheap money , ' `` julian jessop , chief global economist at capit econom , said in a note to client .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rate to more normal but still low level to be the seismic shock that mani seem to fear .
that 's not to say there wo n't be effect , howev .
here 's a look at how some area of the economi could react , base on histor trend :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip of rate hike can make thing volatil for a while .
onc the hike hit , though , the impact is not as dramat .
`` it doe seem there is a trend for equiti return to stall 12-24 month after the first hike , which again perhap reflect the lag in monetari polici , '' deutsch bank analyst said in a recent studi of what happen after the fed hike .
more specif , the market over the past 35 year or so is most often up sharpli - about 14 percent - head into the rate hike , fair flat in the 250 day after ( averag gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal onc 500 day have pass , with averag return in the past six cycl of 14.4 percent , accord to a recent analysi bob doll , chief equiti strategist at nuveen asset manag , post on barron 's .
deutsch said the impact on stock tend to get more pronounc later in the rate-hik cycl and return begin to diminish .
recess are a fact of econom life , but rate hike often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is face some condit that did not exist befor and could hasten a recess .
most notabl , gross domest product will be near it lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
accord to deutsch bank , in the 118 rate hike sinc 1950 , onli twice has nomin year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter track at just 1.5 percent , accord to the atlanta fed .
hike rate into such a fragil econom backdrop could be riski and set up the question of `` whether this time is differ , '' deutsch said .
market particip have been brace for a fed hike all year , with all eye turn toward this week 's feder open market committe meet , which end thursday .
while mani strategist and economist believ the fomc could approv a hike at this meet , futur trade indic just a 25 percent probabl .
`` in our studi sinc 1950 , all hike cycl to date have been in a super cycl of increas leverag with gdp eclips prerecess peak veri quick post the recoveri commenc , '' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniqu slow recoveri from what was the worst recess in the sampl period .
the current cycl is by far the longest the fed has wait sinc the end of the last recess ; the record had been 35 month , and this is 74 month and count .
fix incom also has been volatil as the market anticip a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equiti experi .
the princip differ is that the impact happen faster in bond than stock when the fed chang cours in polici .
for bond , it doe seem yield chang direct immedi as the first hike/cut in the cycl arriv .
at the end of the hike cycl bond yield fall immedi , '' deutsch said .
charl schwab strategist believ the hike in rate will caus yield between longer- and shorter-d bond to move closer togeth , flatten the curv .
high-yield bond often perform better in such a climat , though `` we are still cautious about stretch for yield , '' kathi jone , fix incom analyst at schwab , said in an analysi .
interest , jone think market alreadi have adapt to fed polici expect .
`` in addit to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflat expect , there are sever sign that the market has adjust to the prospect of tighter monetari polici , '' she wrote .
short-term interest rate are up , the yield curv is flatter , credit spread have widen and volatil has increas - all characterist of the market when the fed tighten polici .
broad speak , compani that do the major of their busi in the u.s. will win as interest rate rise and local product becom more attract .
multin with lot of debt will fare wors , as a rise dollar make their product more expens in the global market space and their debt more expens the financ .
`` histori show that qualiti ' stock tend to outperform dure the three month follow an initi rate hike , '' goldman sach analyst said in a report for client .
firm with strong balanc sheet outpac weak balanc sheet compani follow each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hike , by an averag of 5 percentag point .
compani with high return on capit as well as low volatil stock also outperform their lower qualiti counterpart , by an averag of 4 ( percentag point ) and 3 ( percentag point ) , respect .
debt will becom a big issu .
compani with a high percentag of float rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outsid pure stock play , consum stand to benefit as well through the rise dollar .
saver could see gain as well through higher yield at the , though expert differ on how quick that will take hold .

sure david cameron know the lorax better than this ?
it 's one thing ani parent soon learn : when your child love a book , it wo n't be long befor you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seem , you are david cameron .
ask by a provid of holiday childcar scheme to name his favourit kid ' book , the prime minist opt for the lorax , the 1971 environment fabl by dr seuss .
it was a difficult choic , cameron write in a messag publish on the websit of the supercamp compani , continu : `` funni , move , creativ and with a power messag , it 's one i enjoy read to my children becaus there alway seem to be an imag or a messag that we have previous miss . ''
all veri well , except that the subsequ paragraph in which cameron suppos describ the plot of the book instead give a précis of the 2012 film version , which ad new charact and detail to pad out the fair brief origin text .
`` set in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where all natur has gone and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey , by fulfil her wish to see a real tree , '' it read , chronicl a love interest unknown to dr seuss , real name theodor seuss geisel , who die in 1991 .
if that was n't suspici enough , cameron 's submit text read in part like a plot summari of the lorax film provid on the internet movi databas websit , which begin : `` in the wall citi of thneed-vill , where everyth is artifici and even the air is a commod , a boy name ted hope to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey . ''
given he is an avow hands-on parent , it seem unlik cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young unnam boy hear how the local environ was devast by the avarici , tree-chop , thneed-knit once-l , despit the protest of the eponym lorax , a squat , moustachio creatur who `` speak for the tree . ''
most like , such a relat lowli pr task would have been outsourc to an aid , seem one who has never read the lorax 20 time in a row to a child .
a down street spokeswoman said the text was believ to have come from cameron 's constitu offic .
supercamp confirm that the text was provid from cameron 's staff , but had no further immedi comment .
adam lyth was clear at risk of england omiss but it 's still tough
take on pakistan in the unit arab emir is a tough assign but after see the squad england have select for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test seri defeat suffer last time doe not look on the card for me .
i would n't rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook 's side may be less experienc than the one three year ago but there are good player of spin in that bat lineup and the collect mindset is strong ; they will not carri scar from 2012 , onli a youth posit .
with the ball , moeen ali is develop as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantiti at test level , repres an attack option .
relat : adam lyth drop from england test squad and replac by alex hale
the decis to omit adam lyth is obvious a tough one for me to analys as his head coach at yorkshir .
his seven test have been against two good attack in challeng condit and the simpl but harsh realiti is that cricket are judg on output .
there were no question mark over joe root , for exampl , lead up to the announc becaus - and i have said this befor - player are their own best selector .
a coupl of half-centuri and lyth might have seen his run extend but he was in control of his own destini .
hope if he punch out more run for yorkshir anoth opportun will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , prais his attitud even when he was not perform as well as he can and that doe not surpris me ; he is a team man abov all els .
the question of how long a test batsman get to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven cap - like sam robson befor him - while nick compton got nine .
onli compton got the chanc home and away .
the onli gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wast opportun is in the past now .
alex hale come in and he is a batsman i rate high .
he is an x-factor cricket , which we at yorkshir saw earli this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridg pitch that was do a bit .
he must at least be afford the same opportun as those befor him but this will of cours depend on the make-up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen open the bat alongsid cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keep four quick , has been float and it is not someth i am against .
i do n't see whi a strokemak can not bat there and this left-hand has alreadi shown he is one hell of a cricket .
moeen may not have done the job for his counti , worcestershir , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much differ .
my old team-mat justin langer play his first 38 test at first drop befor step up to open in 2001 .
he peel off three centuri immedi and did not look back .
zafar ansari come into the squad as back-up spinner and , in my limit deal with him , he has struck me as veri impress young man .
peopl may look at his raw stat - averag 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a punt but there are not a heap of spinner put their hand up and selector have opt for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a coupl of shrewd addit to their coach staff .
the appoint of mahela jayawarden , the sri lanka batsman , as a consult for the test match could be a masterstrok .
he is one of the game 's loveliest bloke , who will bring a wealth of experi have done it in all condit and against all attack .
paul collingwood come in for the white-bal leg of the tour and will bring both energi and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i alway felt he was born to be involv in intern cricket , be it play or coach , and like mahela has nous that can be tap .
sometim new voic in the dress room , even if the messag are consist with what has been said befor , can freshen up a side .
colli 's durham team-mat ben stoke is rest for the one-day , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issu with this .
while not everyon will agre , the coach and selector do not set the schedul .
and you have to rememb , like player , their job are depend on result .
such decis are never taken light .
brexit camp might win the day if economi is in doldrum by 2017
david cameron 's half-bak renegoti strategi for keep britain in the eu get deeper into troubl with everi day that pass , even without the elect of genial jeremi `` is it yes or no ? '' corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cut up rough over europ on tuesday .
foreign have their corbyn and nigel farag too .
a european diplomat chum explain the other day that , sunk in assort crise as the eu is - not all of their own make - some member state are fed up with britain 's self-absorb agenda of divis concess and disrupt treati chang which they most do n't want .
in brighton for it annual bean , the tuc decid it did n't want them either if they erod social protect .
we could even call it dave and georg 's selfi agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summit or bilater session in foreign capit , take a photo of themselv in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grande , then come home and say they are win alli for reform .
it 's all about me .
my european pal , who want an outward-look britain insid the eu tent - `` do n't leav us alon with franc , '' say berlin - suggest that more short-sight minist and offici in some capit have got to the point where they do n't care whether we stay or leav .
angela merkel , germani 's cautious level-head chancellor , is an alli , but has been in power for 10 year and want to leav offic befor it goe bad for her , as it did for overstay thatcher ( 11 year ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
franc 's françoi holland is face re-elect or replac in 2017 .
he is a fade forc too .
poland may soon have a nationalist govern of the right , spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them break a leg to help the selfi brit , whose energi might be better spent prevent scotland leav the uk - someth they do n't want either becaus most have similar separatist tendenc .
so some such minist may even be plan to make deliber unhelp remark , snp-style , dure the uk 's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggest .
`` the renegoti was a fix '' and `` britain got noth of valu out of the renegoti . ''
the european know to their cost how predatori fleet street can be and how eu-scept the oligarch press baron are , as they were not dure the toni benn-inspir 1975 referendum which endors our 1973 entri by a ratio of 2:1 .
they may dim rememb bori johnson , the arch euro-opportunist , make his name as an `` eu straight banana '' brussel correspond in the earli 90s .
for all his foolish ed miliband knew who his enemi were .
they includ the medley of tax-shi rascal , phone-hack foreign and pseudo non-dom who own most of our great newspap .
actual toni blair thought much the same about them , but realis that when you re in a cage with a randi gorilla you have to pass the banana to distract it from have you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairit than blair in oppos cameron 's referendum wheez , sinc blair had conced the principl over the eu 's abort constitut , sunk by french and dutch voter in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
the press never forgav him that either .
but nice jeremi corbyn , who gave me a friend pat on the back at westminst on monday - i told him he no longer has time to wast on me - seem to be in danger of re-adopt neil kinnock 's boycott murdoch strategi of the 80s , a mistak then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coher strategi to engag with the media , not with me , but certain with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacat on sunday .
corbyn 's offici posit on europ is what i will kind call evolv .
he say he 'd like us to stay in a reform eu .
well , most peopl outsid ukip 's woad-wear tendenc and the wilder shore of tori littl englander can probabl say yes to that .
it 's what hilari `` a benn , but not a bennit '' benn said on radio and tv this week as the boy scout in him struggl not to admit that corbyn 's appoint of abras john mcdonnel as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it remind me of the 70s , when his old dad struggl on tv to be disloy to labour cabinet colleagu without go too far and lose his cabinet job .
hilari 's struggl was more attract .
but fight to stay in `` in all circumst '' - benn 's phrase - was not what mcdonnel was say , nor what jc told peer and mps at their privat meet on monday night , by all account .
whatev the bottom-up , touchy-fe imag corbyn want to convey - rememb , he even touch me - messag disciplin remain import in the age of 24/7 tv and especi in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotb of paranoia and betray .
it 's fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europ , allow him to take labour 's support for grant in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnel has said .
simon jenkin certain think so .
but mcdonnel and corbyn 's basic equivoc about eu membership - consist with their bennit sieg economi , anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoter discuss among leftw dissid for whom the narciss of small differ is a central tenet of doctrin squabbl .
as with his equivoc over nato - tom watson is adam that jc wo n't campaign to quit - foreign diplomat will be oblig to tri to make sens of it all for their master at home .
whi should pari or berlin wast polit capit - they have suspici voter too - on concess to britain when it may all be pointless ?

expert criticis public health england e-cigarett review
claim by a government-fund agenc that e-cigarett are 95 % less harm than smoke aros from a meet of 12 peopl , some with link to the tobacco industri , research have said .
expert write in the british medic journal ( bmj ) join the lancet in criticis the evid use by public health england ( phe ) in it report on e-cigarett .
phe publish the `` landmark '' report last month , describ it as a `` comprehens review of the evid . ''
but sever research have question the robust of the data and point to link between some expert and the tobacco industri .
an editori in the lancet medic journal last month attack the `` extraordinarili flimsi foundat '' on which phe base it main conclus .
write in the bmj , two further research have question whether the claim were `` built on rock or sand . ''
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygien and tropic medicin , and simon capewel , professor of clinic epidemiolog at the univers of liverpool , said : `` a fundament principl of public health is that polici should be base on evid of effect . ''
they said the public would expect phe 's claim that `` the current best estim is that e-cigarett are around 95 % less harm than smoke '' would be base on a detail review of evid and model .
in fact , it come from a singl meet of 12 peopl conven to develop a multi-criteria decis analysi ( mcda ) model to synthesis their opinion on the harm associ with differ nicotine-contain product ; the result of the meet were summaris in a research paper .
mckee and capewel said one sponsor of the meet was a compani call euroswiss health , whose chief execut was report to have previous receiv fund from british american tobacco for an independ studi .
he also endors bat 's public health credenti in a sustain report , they said .
one of the 12 peopl at the meet declar fund from an e-cigarett manufactur but not the fund he was report to have receiv previous from the tobacco compani philip morri intern , they ad .
the rational for select the member of the panel is not provid , but they includ sever known e-cigarett champion , some of whom also declar industri fund in the paper .
some other present at the meet are not known for their expertis in tobacco control .
the meet was also attend by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produc by the group `` tell conced '' there is a lack of `` hard evid for the harm of most product on most of the criteria , '' mckee and capewel wrote .
howev , none of these link or limit are discuss in the phe report .
mckee and capewel said phe 's claim that `` there is no evid so far that e-cigarett are act as a rout into smoke for children or non-smok '' were prematur .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellb at phe , said the claim in the bmj had been respond to befor .
he said : `` e-cigarett are signific less harm than smoke . ''
one in two lifelong smoker die from their addict .
all of the evid suggest that the health risk pose by e-cigarett are small by comparison , but we must continu to studi the long-term effect .
phe has a clear duti to inform the public about what the evid show and what it doe not show , especi when there was so much public confus about the relat danger compar to tobacco .
near 80,000 peopl a year die of a smoking-rel ill and smoke cost the nhs £2bn a year .
by spell out clear the current evid - that while e-cigarett are not risk-fre , they carri onli a fraction of the harm caus by smoke - we are fulfil our nation remit .
bbc should give up eastend , say former channel 4 chief
the former channel 4 chairman luke johnson has said the bbc should stop broadcast programm such as eastend and the voic , say it commerci rival would `` give their right arm '' for hit show such as the albert squar soap .
johnson said the licenc fee should onli be use to make the sort of programm that are not made by other uk broadcast .
he criticis the bbc for put public servic programm like to be watch by a smaller audienc in tough slot against it rival '' biggest rate show , and on channel such as bbc4 .
after the bbc 's director general , toni hall , said the corpor want to do more in partnership with other organis , johnson said he had tri for six year in his time at channel 4 to do a tie-up with the bbc without success .
`` i do struggl with the idea that the bbc commiss and broadcast programm that would clear be shown by unsubsidis rival , '' johnson told the hous of lord communic committe , as part of it inquiri into the futur of the bbc .
if you keep the licenc fee , which i 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduc it output at least to programm that other are n't make and commiss .
they broadcast the voic in a prime slot becaus they want to gain as broad a support as possibl for it futur .
the idea that no one els would show that is a joke , it 's ludicr , it 's obvious nonsens .
johnson said : `` i do n't see whi a regress tax should fund programm that could be fund without subsidi .
the voic is one , eastend is anoth , admit made in-hous .
frank other channel would give their right arm for it .
i struggl to see how it 's public servic broadcast .
i do n't think that would diminish the bbc at all .
johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the bbc was guilti of chase rate `` becaus of the ambit of peopl who work there , and becaus they believ that is the best way to secur long-term support . ''
his comment about the bbc 's most popular show echo those of former sky execut toni ball , who use his mactaggart lectur in edinburgh in 2003 to propos that the bbc sell off show such as eastend .
johnson said the bbc 's more nich public servic programm `` go on to bbc4 where quit often you ca n't measur the audienc but they fulfil their remit and they can argu when they go on their sanctimoni mission about justifi £4bn in licenc fee incom , `` well of cours , we do all these obscur programm that no one watch . ''
they put them on a slot where no one was ever go to watch them .
on the licenc fee , johnson told the committe : `` i challeng you to find a more regress system in term of who get the best valu from it .
of cours you all think , we all think , £150 a year is great valu , but for peopl for whom £150 is a lot of money i wonder if they do becaus they do n't consum a lot of the bbc .
former sky and channel 5 execut david elstein , who also gave evid to the committe on tuesday , said the bbc should revis it reithian mission to `` inform , educ and entertain . ''
he said littl of the bbc 's output was now formal classifi as educ - he said it was 1 % of it tv output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public servic broadcast in australia and canada and chang it to `` inform , enlighten and entertain . ''
on the issu of partnership , elstein said the bbc should do more in area such as the prom , of which he said onli a hand were shown on tv , and enter into allianc with commerci broadcast to make them all avail to watch onlin .
sonogenet ' allow brain cell to be control by sound wave
the video show how the nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls .
scientist have bred worm with genet modifi nervous system that can be control by burst of sound wave .
the tini nematod chang direct the moment they are blast with sonic puls that are too high-pitch for human to hear .
the puls work by switch on motor neuron cell that are genet modifi to carri membran channel that respond to ultrason wave .
relat : research read and write brain activ with light
research said the worm demonstr the power of a new procedur , dub sonogenet , in which ultrasound can be use to activ a rang of brain , heart and muscl cell from outsid the bodi .
sreekanth chalasani , a research at the salk institut in la jolla , california , told the guardian that the procedur could one day replac deep-brain stimul , an invas procedur that deliv electr puls into peopl 's brain to treat symptom of parkinson 's diseas .
nematod worm do not usual react to ultrasound , but chalasani found that they did when they were surround by a fluid contain microscop bubbl .
the bubbl , he found , amplifi the ultrason wave which then pass insid the worm .
the amplifi ultrasound wave act on structur call trp-4 ion channel , found in the membran of some of the worm '' cell .
the sound wave make these ion channel open up and activ the cell they are attach to , accord to a report in natur communic .
to make ultrasound-control nematod , chalasani genet modifi the worm so that some of their motor neuron carri trp-4 ion channel .
when he appli ultrasound to the modifi creatur , the sound wave were amplifi by the microbubbl and transmit into the worm , where they switch on the modifi motor neuron .
the procedur has some similar with optogenet , a groundbreak tool that allow scientist to switch neuron on and off with puls of light .
but chalasani said that sonogenet could have some advantag over that techniqu .
unlik light , which has to be sent down an optic fibr to the desir locat insid the brain , low frequenc ultrasound wave can pass through tissu unhind , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
`` we believ that , use gene therapi and a therapeut virus , it may be possibl to make target human neuron temporarili suscept to the ultrasound signal in a clinic set for certain neurolog treatment , '' said chalasani .

it 's tempt to babbl : tell peopl where you re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on corbyn and whi you `` honest neither love nor hate marmit becaus serious guy it 's just yeast extract hahaha i ll be in my room . ''

peopl 's room often morph into drink recept , movie-night venu and communal hangout spot , but they re also where peopl get dress and adjust their underwear .
relat : do n't even think about start univers in a relationship

your room should be a retreat , yet mani hall form an inter-room-strol cultur that 's friend , social and conduc to lifelong friendship .
that can be hell for someon who 's tri to recharg .

sinc you re start uni at the height of bake-off mania , knock on peopl 's door to introduc yourself with a plate of browni seem margin less weird , less 1950s `` welcom to the neighbourhood , i bake you someth , now smile as i ask you person question . ''

accord to research from the consult compani wood mackenzi , low oil price were the caus of the suspens of the 380 billion dollar-project for oil and gas exploration/product , and the product of million of barrel of oil was postpon in a vast area reach from the mexican gulf to africa .

400 billion dollar on hold
while the crude oil price continu to surpris everi singl day , it has recent fallen under the 30 dollar mark , which is it lowest level in the last 12 year .
in these day of heat debat about `` whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dollar '' , or `` whether oil is dirt cheap '' , the research publish by the energi consult firm wood mackenzi reveal how the sector has been affect by the fall price .
suggest that the fall oil price caus the suspens of 46 big energi invest worth 200 billion dollar in a report publish in juli , wood mackenzi , in new research , disclos what the total figur was up to the end of 2015 .
accord to this , while 22 more project were postpon in the last six month of 2015 , a total of 68 project were suspend from 2014 , when the drop in oil price began .
the valu of these project is estim at around 400 billion dollar .
2.9 million barrel per day
in the research , it has been underlin that the low oil price had a `` brutal '' effect on compani plan and it has been note that the project most affect were deep water develop project .
the suspend project correspond to a total reserv of 27 billion barrel of crude oil , and the daili product of 2.9 million barrel has therefor been delay until 2025 .

the report underlin that the postpon 68 project includ a potenti 170 billion dollar invest that is predict to be carri out in the next 5 year , and `` most of the 170 billion dollar is compris of deep water project '' .

eye on iran
just four year ago the situat was as follow : the u.s. and europ impos an embargo on iran oil to stop tehran 's nuclear program ; the barrel price of oil was around 110 dollar and debat centr on how iran 's oil export would be cut without caus ani sharp jump in the price .
when we return to this week , we wit a veri differ scenario .
oil price have fallen below 30 dollar for the first time sinc 2004 , and the princip caus of this was the product boom in the u.s. ; and embargo impos on iran be abolish .
for this reason , all the eye are on iran .
if iran increas it oil export , more oil will be ad to the market , which is said to be alreadi quit full .
this may caus the price to fall below even the surpris level of today .
some analyst are say that saudi arabia , not want to lose ani market share to iran , will pump more oil and iran and s. arabia will enter a price war .
soon after the elimin of the enforc , it is state that the princip target of iran are india , be the fastest grow oil market in asia , and it old partner in europ .
iranian offici have previous said that they aim to increas initi export by 500 thousand barrel a day and to add the same amount to the market after a while .
accord to the map data from reuter , there are 22 veri larg crude carrier ( vlcc ) wait off the coast of iran , 13 of which are fulli or most load .
iran is in the posit of be the countri with the fourth biggest proven oil reserv in the world .
thank to except within the embargo , iran current export approxim 1 million barrel of crude oil to some countri includ turkey .
befor the embargo , iran 's daili oil export increas to 3 million barrel a day .
a research specialist at secur compani destek menkul değerl , aysun göksu , answer the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dollar as follow : `` china-centr global growth concern increas downward pressur on commod price and intensifi the drop in oil price . ''
we are see that loss reach 20 percent sinc the begin of the year amid concern that the demand for oil would declin in line with the econom slowdown in china , which is the biggest oil import in the world .
in addit to this , we may wit oil price below 30 dollar in the forthcom day due to the effect of the global appreci of the dollar and the problem of global excess suppli .
as long as we do not see ani perman price abov the 32-33 dollar-level , the upward movement of oil price may remain limit and the downward pressur on price may increas .
at that point , we can say that close price under the 30 dollar-level will play a key role in the continu of the declin .
in this situat , it should be no surpris if it is seen that there is a loosen of the support level of 23.30-25.60 in the lower end .

david bowi - blackstar : the alien 's `` last album ''
know that you will die ; produc that final album without tell anyon ; make your deathb an artist express in the music video you shot ...
these kind of action may seem `` extrem '' to us mortal earthl .
i say mortal earthl becaus i am among those who believ that the man who did this is both immort and alien .
he came to our world from some corner of the univers ; now he has return to his motherland ; which is just how it goe .
he came becaus it was necessari to inspir not onli kiss , marilyn manson or ladi gaga , but also all the singer of the world .
he fulfil his duti with success .
david bowi , blackstar , itun price : 9.99 tl 5/5
mayb he was nourish by warhol and kubrick from the same planet as him .
when apollo 11 land on earth , he decid to say `` this is noth , i am an alien '' , and he join us by sing `` space odditi '' .
actual he did not join us ; he was alway ahead of us .
thank to him , mani peopl found their way .
both musician and listen ...
if we leav asid his interest in plastic art , his act etc. , it would be wrong to say that his music was `` just music '' .
the charact he creat by himself , travel from song to song , his refer , innov , taboo-break behaviour and discographi reflect an artist integr for me .
i can rememb him neither as the father of glam rock , nor as the cousin of punk ...
if i rememb him like that , what will happen to his avant-gard and electron work , and to jazz , which he kept as an intern love sinc his childhood ?
david bowi alway remind us what the express `` icon '' mean , up until that time when the word spread like wildfir .
he was not a man ; he was not a woman ; he was not `` human '' .
he was a bodi .
it seem to us that he was on a mission .
that bodi left this world two day after the releas of his 26th studio album `` blackstar '' .
he tri to prepar us for the fact that he would leav with `` blackstar '' and `` lazarus '' , which we had listen to befor the releas of the album .
we thought that `` he has gotten old now , so he talk about death '' , but he was awar of everyth .
one more final hand ...
we can say that there are four song that we alreadi knew when the album was releas ; `` blackstar '' and `` lazarus '' , shoulder the burden of messag and emot , `` sue ( or in a season of crime ) '' and `` tis a piti she was a whore '' , previous releas but re-record for this album .
i would add that the remain song , `` girl love me '' , `` i ca n't give everyth away '' and `` dollar day '' , are also veri good .
when we look at `` blackstar '' as a whole , it was creat on a veri strong music structur , but it feel like it was produc with sincer and instantan feel as well .
it is an album neither of death nor a `` reckon with the past '' ...
it is just a real `` final '' album .
`` the end '' caption of a life in music , which is a masterpiec in it entireti .

how to use the mid-term break ?
how should student use the mid-term break ? - we ask this question to educ specialist and student coach , murat aydın .
student should not onli think of mid-term break as spend time rest , entertain and watch televis .
mid-term break is an import opportun to get readi for the new school term and to review last term .
be free time , the mid-term break is also a good opportun for person develop , acquisit of knowledg and skill , and take up a new hobbi .
make a list of what to do dure the term .
write down everyth you plan to do , and tri to put it into practic .
you can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more effici term .
now , first , let 's talk about how effici the term should be for student prepar for the ygs-lys exam .
becaus the most common question come from the student prepar for ygs-lys are as follow : `` how should we use this time , should we solv a lot of question or finish incomplet subject ? ''
first , let introduc our articl with both the answer to these question and some advic to those who are prepar for the exam in order to spend the time effici .
while the prepar period for the exam should be a process that start from the 9th grade , under normal condit , we are tri instead to complet it in the final 1 year ; this oblig us to spend our last year more effect , by use our time more effici and proper .
a final grade student must deal with both the exam prepar and prepar for school written exam at the same time .
even if the graduat student have finish school and experienc the exam ( ygs-lys ) at least onc , the year they prepar for the exam again as a graduat student is critic import for them as well .
becaus most graduat student and their famili see `` that '' year as a last chanc , which creat greater stress .
revis is the studi that student do not like ; they do it becaus they feel oblig to do it ; and therefor they alway postpon it to the last moment ; but it becom complet a duti for the student that do it regular and make it a habit ; and there is alway a plan for what and when thing need to be done .
now we have a mid-term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possibl .
to do this , we should alway have a plan that allow us to manag our time well .
studi for lesson dure mid-term break :
first , everyon should make a plan suitabl to their situat .
1 . they should includ what they have cover , what are the incomplet subject in their plan and they should plan their day , week and 15-day period .
there should be both lesson revis and question solv in this period .
in the meantim , student that do not have ani incomplet subject can solv 1 or 2 mock exam on averag .
deal with your incomplet subject : studi show that peopl forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week , 66 percent in a day , and 54 percent in an hour .
the best and most effect method of elimin this tendenc to forget is by do revis .
especi student who make too mani error in prior lesson should concentr on studi with general revis .
first , determin what are the incomplet subject and make your plan everyday ; choos one lesson everyday and complet deal with it .
this plan will help you in both academ and psycholog situat .
when ad subject to your plan , pay attent to the subject you make the most error in .
becaus there will be no long holiday period in the futur .
solv question :
question solv is as import as revis lesson .
becaus we can see how much we understand the subject we studi onli through the feedback from the question we solv .
do not forget to select a number of question to be solv each day .
the number of question you solv may chang in line with what you studi ; you may not solv mani question on a day that you most studi lesson , but we should still solv question to a certain extent , at least in order to see how much we learn from the lesson of that day .
solv mock exam :
anoth area of studi to look into dure mid-term break should be solv mock exam .
even if all the subject are not finish , you can solv mock exam at least for each lesson .
suppos that you finish a turkish lesson , you can solv a 40-question mock exam of turkish .
you should definit keep track of time while do this .
if you solv 40 turkish question in 60 minut , your next target should be to complet it sever minut faster .
vacat and hobbi plan :
of cours , a break doe not onli mean studi for lesson , you should spare a few day for vacat , to rest and spend time on your hobbi .
a holiday period spent onli studi for lesson will stop you from have fun and relax .
for this reason , there should be special time set asid for yourself .
read book , watch televis or surf the internet may be in your plan , but the most import thing is how much time you spare for each activ .
i have some advic for those who say that i could not spend the first term effici .
if you can say that i could not spend the first term well , i could not studi much and i miss mani lesson , this mid-term break is a big opportun for you as well .
nevertheless , you should first decid on and believ this .
most of the goal in the 2009-2010 turkish super leagu were score between minut 76 and 90 .
now , answer the question you ask ; do you go to the locker room after the end of the match or is the match still continu and is there enough time for you to score a goal ?
i suppos that no one want to say , `` we will look forward to our next match '' , a convent express use by the coach or player of a lose footbal team .
now , the onli thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past , and run instead of walk .
to summar what we said :
1 ) first make a mid-term break plan ,
2 ) revis the lesson you know ,
3 ) finish ani incomplet subject ,
4 ) consolid what you have learn by solv question ,
5 ) solv mock exam ,
6 ) read book ,
7 ) determin new goal for next term ,
8 ) spare time for you , your hobbi and the thing you enjoy ,
9 ) spare time for your famili and your friend ,
10 ) spare time for social and cultur activ ( cinema , sport , theatr , concert , travel , picnic , etc . )

analyst expect $ 10.84 , accord to a survey by factset .
the reduc outlook come despit rate hike averag 4.9 percent , which will take effect jan. 4 , and higher surcharg for ground shipment of heavi or larg packag , which begin in novemb .
the compani said it still expect earn to grow over the previous year becaus of cost-cut , higher revenu and growth in onlin commerc .
chairman and ceo fred smith said the compani was `` perform solid given weaker-than-expect econom condit , especi in manufactur and global trade . ''
the holiday-hir plan were announc a day after rival up said that that it plan to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra worker , about the same that it hire last year .
in the quarter that end aug. 31 , fedex earn $ 692 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .

six analyst survey by zack expect $ 12.23 billion .
fedex has been hit in recent year by a declin in prioriti intern ship , which has caus revenu in it express unit to stagnat .
but the boom in onlin shop has boost result at fedex ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenu rose 29 percent but oper incom was basic flat on higher cost for larger packag and self-insur .
the express unit saw higher incom becaus of higher base rate , while incom fell in the freight busi on higher labor cost .
in premarket trade about an hour befor the open bell , fedex share were down $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
they close tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on june 11 .
at their most anticip meet in year , feder reserv policymak will spend two day this week seat around a 27-foot honduran mahogani tabl decid if it 's time to rais a key interest rate for the first time in near a decad .
loom over them at one end of the central bank 's ornat , two-stori boardroom will be a mural of the unit state .
the map is a remind that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagu are suppos to put the nation 's econom interest abov all other .
the central bank has a dual charg from congress : maxim u.s. employ and keep price here stabl .
but sinc the great recess , fed leader have acknowledg that there 's an unwritten third mandat : financi stabil .
and that third mandat could be the x-factor in a too-close-to-predict decis , to be announc thursday , about whether the u.s. economi is readi to start be wean from the unpreced stimulus provid by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place sinc late 2008 .
even though most data show the economi grow solid , the recent turmoil in global financi market could make already-cauti fed offici skittish about ad to the volatil by rais their benchmark feder fund rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentag point .
`` obvious the labor market and inflat is go to be first and foremost the most import thing they watch , '' said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerag firm stifel nicolaus & co .
`` but i think if they were look for an excus not to rais the rate , the increas uncertainti surround the global marketplac is enough to provid them with justif to wait further , '' she said .
there 's no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is caus financi market jitter .
about half of economist survey recent by bloomberg predict a rate increas this week .
financi market , howev , are expect the fed to hold off , with a key indic show onli about a 30 % chanc of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed rais the rate , unless policymak were to soften the blow by promis that anoth increas would be a way off .
on tuesday , the dow jone industri averag jump 228.89 point , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the ralli was trigger by expect that fed policymak will hold the rate steadi this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moodi 's capit market research group .
`` it would be a surpris if the fed hike rate at this point in time , '' he said .
if fed policymak did , `` they would have to go to great length in their polici statement to hold financi market ' hand so they do n't panic . ''
other expert argu that a rate increas would calm financi market becaus it would remov uncertainti about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seem on track to rais the rate by 0.25 percentag point this month , the first small step in a slow tighten of monetari condit that would valid the strength of the u.s. recoveri .
yellen had said through the spring and earli summer that she expect a rate increas this year despit complaint from liber that more econom progress was need .
although job creation slow in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemploy rate drop to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven year and near the level the fed consid to be full employ .
wage gain have shown sign of pick up .
and although inflat continu to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , fed policymak said a key reason was the temporari effect of sharpli lower oil price .
the economi `` can cope with higher rate , and need them , given the tight of the labor market , '' said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconom .
but financi market around the world start convuls late last month after china devalu it currenc .
the dow jone industri averag drop as much as 16 % below it record high in may as investor fear a slow chines economi would drag down global growth .
the market has rebound somewhat this month , with the dow now down near 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymak , the market turmoil add to the complex calculus of when to rais the interest rate .
`` absent what happen in financi market and the news about the weak in the chines economi over the past coupl week , they would be tighten at this meet , '' said stephen d. olin , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estat and a former fed offici .
now , he predict they ll wait at least a month to get a better handl on the effect .
`` there 's a lot of uncertainti about what the impact on the u.s. economi are go to be , and they have almost no data to reli on that post-dat the develop in china , '' olin said .
the health of the global economi is n't one of the fed 's primari concern , so technic it should n't be factor into it decision-mak .
but , in effect , the fed has becom the monetari author of the world .
the central bank 's influenc in recent year has been enorm .
the mere hint by then-chairman ben s. bernank in 2013 that the fed might `` taper '' it monetari expans trigger market convuls around the globe .
in a world where market and economi are increas intertwin , fed offici can be expect not onli to monitor the develop elsewher but also to consult with other central banker and expert to get a better read on the global economi .
it decision-mak process is `` more art than scienc , '' said zachari karabel , head of global strategi for wealth-manag firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , presid of the feder reserv bank of richmond , va. , note this month that `` the fed has a histori of overreact to financi market movement that seem unconnect to econom fundament . ''
lacker , a vote member of the policymak feder open market committe who has been push for a rate increas , cite decis in 1998-99 as an exampl .
a financi crisi in asia led the fed to cut it benchmark rate by 0.75 percentag point over three meet `` despit limit identifi implic for u.s. growth , '' lacker said .
a year later , fed offici revers those cut .
the fed should put financi stabil concern first onli dure a major crisi , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england 's rate-set committe .
the latest turmoil doe n't come close to that level , he said .
`` you certain do n't want to be put in a situat of be scare of a rate hike becaus market got upset , '' said posen , presid of the peterson institut for intern econom .
the feder reserv act still has the dual mandat and doe not mention financi stabil , and until that is chang , i do n't think they should get ahead of the curv .

bmi , a measur of weight in relat to height , is consid normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a bmi of 25 or higher indic that someon is overweight , and peopl with a bmi over 30 are consid obes .

the averag bmi among those who had surgeri fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the studi .
meanwhil , the bmi among those receiv non-surg diabet treatment stay about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgeri , diabet resolv complet in 36 percent and partial in 28 percent .
in the medically-tr group , by comparison , diabet resolv complet in onli 1 percent and partial in onli about 2 percent .
in addit , control of blood pressur , triglycerid , and `` bad '' ldl cholesterol `` was general better in the surgic group , '' the author found .

while the new studi doe not show a surviv benefit or surgeri after five year , there is evid from a studi of heavier peopl in sweden that surgeri doe lead to a longer life , say blackston , of the univers of arizona colleg of medicine-phoenix .
in the swedish studi , obes peopl who had bariatr surgeri were about 29 percent less like to die over 15 year , compar to a group who tri more convent method .

the invit was first made back in januari , via his best friend , and though i was shock , i agre .
as the day approach , i ve come to dread it .
so whi do it ?
i agre becaus i thought it was a good way of tell the full stori about the death penalti .
it would offer a uniqu perspect .
true , journalist are permit to watch execut in america and becaus there are often more applic than seat avail , a macabr lotteri take place to decid who will be chosen .

i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison author say i can not be both a wit and a journalist , so i wo n't be allow a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to tri to rememb all the detail .
one oklahoma journalist accus me on twitter of compromis my imparti .
here 's the lesson .
tell the inmat 's stori the way he like it , get access .
i complain to her .
she admit that she `` could have phrase it better , '' but still think i 'm wrong to do what i 'm do .
richard glossip has taken issu with some of the thing i ve said and written .
he doe n't tell me what to write , and i would n't do it even if he did .
i ve told him he can remov me from his list of wit at ani time .
but he want an intern report to be there to write about it .
if he die , he think the public will help the anti-death penalti movement .
kim bellwar , a report from the huffington post , will be alongsid me .
if you want to know more about the case , pleas listen to the seri of podcast i ve made .
i wo n't go over all the detail again here .
i can not say with certainti that richard glossip is innoc .
his action after the murder of barri van trees would make him guilti of be an accessori after the fact .

i certain believ there was not enough evid to justifi a death sentenc .
i believ his execut is wrong .
and it 's from this perspect that i will watch him die .

`` that keep come up - i did n't hear trent robinson bring up wrestl when they beat us 24-2 , '' bellami said on wednesday .
i can guarante we have n't chang noth all year with our defens system or techniqu , it 's just that the last six week we have made a real emphasi with our contact in tackl and that has been the turn around for us .
trent has been there three year and he obvious has a great side to coach so he is probabl not use to lose so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it 's funni how this alway come up at this time of year .
bellami challeng bennett 's idea of `` excit footbal '' remind his mentor that bennett 's st george-illawarra dragon won the premiership in 2010 by play `` bore '' footbal .
wayn is talk about excit footi .
he made a point of compar his game on saturday night with our one on friday night and how excit their game was , '' bellami said .
i rememb in 2010 st georg was criticis a lot for be a bore team and wayn said he did n't give a rat 's ars .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as excit footi , especi his young halv with their speed .
that 's the footi you would want to play when you have those sort of player .
he made that point in 2010 , now he want everyon to play his style of footi - not everi team has two halv like anthoni milford and ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it build more confid becaus they are say these thing becaus they are a littl bit concern about play us .
six week ago they probabl were n't think of us when they get to the big game .

the bronco game was probabl a good game , i have n't watch it yet but what was the score ? 16-12 ?
our game it was 20-18 , there was two more tri in our game but is that excit footi ?
or is it make break and not score tri that is excit ?

hürrem sultan 's red hair , beren 's nose , justin 's hair ...
tri to look like celebr is consid normal to some extent but it is regard as a psycholog disord after the point that it start to complet affect your life .
`` celebr worship syndrom '' , also known as `` the syndrom of worship famous peopl '' is a matter that has alreadi becom an academ issu around the world and is a newli spoken about issu in our countri .
it can be consid normal to some extent that ladi run to the hair salon with photo of celebr .
howev , we should not forget the `` hürrem sultan '' year when all the youth walk around with red irish hair .
it was alreadi report that `` beren 's nose '' led the way in plastic surgeri in 2015 .
the situat is not so veri differ on the part of men .
onc upon a time , dress like polat alemdar was a custom .
now a total differ trend prevail everywher .
our surround are full of young boy that are copi of justin bieber .
it is at such an extent that the follow quot of useless inform was read thousand of time : `` first , when you go to the hairdress , have your hair cut at the side , in other word , the part over and around your ear up to the upper part of your head . ''
howev , the side should be short .
after the cut process is over , you should shape your hair light with water .
after the shape process , fix your hair with the help of spray .
`` it is necessari to shape it when it is wet to get justin hair . ''
all of these issu have alreadi becom academ subject around the world , but they remind us of the newli spoken `` celebr worship syndrom '' , in other word `` the syndrom of worship famous peopl '' .
fan of celebr are consid as a `` bundl of love '' .
artist alway pride themselv on their fan number and how their fan affect them .
luckili , psycholog doe not consid the condit so simpli .
in particular , it is much discuss that adolesc make decis about what they eat and drink , what they listen to , what they wear in accord with celebr .
excess loyalti to peopl present as unattain , and take them as role model is defin as a mental disord .
senior psychologist sümeyy demir accept that turkey fall behind in term of studi into this field .
howev she doe not fail to notic the fact that famili are gradual becom conscious : `` one of the basic issu in the scienc of psycholog is peopl be at peac with themselv and find peac in their ident '' .
in the past , it was not taken serious if children fill their room with poster and play the role of someon .
this situat is now chang .
their parent feel the need to interven in the situat .
`` passion loyalti to someon is a sign of the fact that someth has gone wrong in the teen 's life . ''
fan jump onto the emot speed train
interest in celebr is safe in moder .
demir advis to be care of symptom such as not want them to marri , envi their spous and prefer their cloth style .
as the name impli , we are talk about famous peopl .
be curious about them and have an interest in their life is consid normal to some extent .
howev , young peopl overstep the limit are preval accord to the senior psychologist : `` when there is no one in the famili or the surround to serv as a model for virtu and good behaviour , this gap is certain fill . ''
good exampl do not alway emerg .
`` children also copi the negat thing . ''
when we consult her about how we should approach them , sümeyy demir start by remind us that the syndrom of celebr worship is seen most in adolesc .
the problem is more easili overcom onc it is taken into consider that adolesc may be insecur .
on one hand , we are complain about the limit of famili and on the other hand we are face young peopl expect support and affect from them : `` we are oblig to take into consider their emot up and down . ''
new research put forward that they are forc by the chang occur in their brain .
`` it should be taken natur if an adolesc , jump onto the emot speed train , is attach to someon ; and they should be approach delic . ''
it is possibl to chang behaviour
senior psychologist sümeyy demir , remind us of the duti fall into the share of parent to overcom celebr worship syndrom :
identifi their emot problem and be sure that you are calm befor bring up the issu .
never let them suppress their emot .
express your respect for their ador in order to encourag freedom .
instead of teach them by reprimand , serv as a good model for them , discuss the peopl that can be a role model to them .
tri to talk togeth about the role of celebr in our daili life .
it would be help to read book about the real world of celebr togeth .
chang your communic approach to the form of adult to adult .
do not forget the fact that addict and motiv use the brain in the same way .
tell your child that error are opportun for chang , and accept them as they are .
get the support of specialist deal with be a fan .
those who get angri and those who admir both worship
at the base of the syndrom of celebr worship there is a need to appeal and get help from someon .
it is in fact a unprevent love , a call for help .
but unfortun it is not perceiv like this .
furthermor , this problem is so widespread that it is not possibl to narrow it down to a countri or a contin .
dr. recai yahyaoğlu draw attent to the fact that there are certain peopl that occupi the televis in everi countri .
the syndrom manifest itself most in an attach to the celebr : `` they are extraordinari . ''
most peopl do not have their opportun .
those who have do not live their life by act like them .
it is becaus they do not embrac this life or they do not dare to do it .
`` howev , both those who do not have the opportun , and those who have the opportun but do not live like them continu to watch them angrili . ''
there is no differ between those who covet them and those who watch them burst with anger .
both admir them inward .
they earn money without troubl , they are in magazin daili .
even know this is enough to increas their admir .
other advic from the senior psychologist sümeyy demir is to question the realiti of these live .
we should not fail to notic that artifici live are be talk about .
support from the surround peopl step in for the person who feel passion about celebr .
howev , peopl insist on reject the fact that the celebr they admir also have problem like them .

i have gallston , i have stomach ach when i get up everi morn and after meal ; and i visit the toilet 2 time or more everyday .
could it prevent me from lose weight ?
i have now start to use alkalin , but my appetit for meal has n't diminish , i can not lose ani weight .
it has been the same sinc my childhood .
what should i do ?
in your opinion , should i undergo a cholecystostomi ?

this complaint of stomach ach , occur soon after meal , is a sign of the fact that your gallbladd tighten when you eat and you spill the infect gall into the intestin .
disturb by the infect gall , the intestin tri to quick expel this gall .
this is whi you visit the toilet frequent .
sinc you visit the toilet frequent and what you eat is expel without be digest , lose weight becom slower .
in my opinion , you should have this condit treat .
if you go to a gastroenterologist and the condit is detect as i said , you can be free from this condit by use antibiot .
howev , you may eventu have to undergo a cholecystostomi .
alkalin probiot may decreas your sympton but it doe not cure them .
i advis you to use alkalin probiot anyway .
becaus this probiot powder is the biggest help in lose weight .
i eat too much under stress
dear sir , i eat continu when i am stress and angri ; and i gain weight .
how can i cope with this ?
answer : an excess appetit for food mean in fact that your energi need are not met .
the reason for this may be eat less or skip morn meal and lunch .
anoth reason is your failur to digest the food you eat .
to do this , your digest system should work healthili .
if you do not have a problem such as an ulcer , reflux or similar problem , the easiest way is to use a good probiot medicin .
you will great feel it benefit .
i can not gain weight , doctor do not know the reason
general there is inform about lose weight in your column .
all of it seem logic to me too , but my situat is a littl bit differ .
somehow i can not gain weight .
the most import thing is i do not know whi .
doctor do not say anyth either .
answer : the techniqu we appli are not intend for lose weight , but also regain the physiolog function of the bodi and turn it into it ideal size .
be overweight and be too thin are the same kind of disord .
failur to lose weight when fat and failur to gain weight when slim are cure with the same techniqu .
you lose weight more when you eat sweet and pastri .
i imagin you might have understood this by now .
it is also possibl for you to be stimul with carboxi therapi and gain weight through a healthi diet .
in other word , you becam distant from your ideal bodi by lose weight .
other patient of our becam distant from their ideal bodi by put on weight .
you will reach your ideal bodi by gain weight , and they will do so by lose weight .
if the problem with the system is elimin , you will gain weight , they will lose weight .
nevertheless , first the system should work proper .
